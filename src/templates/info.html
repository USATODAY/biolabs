    <h2 class="iapp-share-intro iapp-panel-text-main">About the labs and records in this interactive</h2>
    <p>USA TODAY identified these biosafety level 3 and biosafety level 4 labs through publicly available information, including government grant records and reports, research published in scientific journals and information found in the organizations’ own websites and press releases.</p>
    <p>To gain insight into the safety records of a diverse group of labs, many of them operated by private organizations that are not subject to goverfreedom of information laws, USA TODAY reporters sought copies of the organizations’ institutional biosafety committee (IBC) records. </p>
    <p>Labs that do research involving genetic manipulations of organisms, or recombinant DNA, and that receive funding from the National Institutes of Health and some other government entities are required under their grants to comply with certain research guidelines. These NIH Guidelines contain a requirement that labs provide copies of their IBC meeting minutes and records of NIH-reportable incidents to any member of the public who requests them.</p>
    <p>The IBC minutes posted on this site generally cover meetings that occurred  in 2013 and 2014. USA TODAY’s request generally sought documents of NIH-reportable incidents that occurred from 2012 to late 2014.</p>
    <p>Although these records provide an important window on an organization’s safety record, they may cover only a subset of the research going on at any given lab because their focus is on rDNA research. Therefore, incidents involving pathogens that aren’t genetically modified may not be reflected in the documents collected here. Also, not all labs receive NIH funding and  may not be subject to the transparency mandated by the NIH Guidelines.</p>
    <p>For many of the labs operated by federal agencies and the military, USA TODAY filed Freedom of Information Act requests for copies of recent lab incident reports. Reporters also filed state open records requests for some state universities.</p>
    <p>Some lab operators, citing a risk of terrorism, balked at providing information about their research, lab accidents or the names of the pathogens involved – even when these organizations publicized research with these same pathogens on their websites, in press releases and in scientific journal articles. Some claimed that the Federal Select Agent Program, which oversees research with organisms that have the potential to be used as bioweapons, prohibits them from releasing information about lab incidents or about the kind of research they do. But that’s not true, said officials at the CDC and USDA, the two agencies that run the select agent program.</p>
    <p>“With the exception of specific security information (such as IT system passwords, key locations and lock combinations), the select agent regulations place no restrictions on the releasing [of] information related to select agents or toxins by regulated entities,” said CDC spokesman Jason McDonald.</p>
    <p>At the USDA’s Animal Plant Health Inspection Service, Freeda Isaac, APHIS’ director of Agriculture Select Agent Services, said: “The CDC and APHIS Federal Select Agent Program has not instructed entities to withhold select agent information from the public.”</p>
    <p>Officials at NIH, a significant funding source for research across the country involving dangerous pathogens – including potential bioterror agents – also have emphasized to grant recipients that the public is entitled to a certain level of transparency. In response to questions from labs about requests for copies of their safety committee records, the NIH issued a November 2014 memo that states: “Integral to the NIH Guidelines … are the principles of public participation and transparency” through the release of biosafety committee minutes and incident reports. </p>
    <p>While institutions can redact certain information for privacy or proprietary concerns, the NIH memo reminded lab officials that “information that is widely available from numerous other sources (e.g., agent names and names of principal investigators) is not generally considered private or proprietary.” </p>
