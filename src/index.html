      <p class="text intro">Hundreds of “high-containment” labs across the U.S. work with dangerous bacteria, viruses and toxins that require special precautions to prevent their release. But because of fragmented oversight, nobody knows where all the labs are, including the federal government. A USA TODAY investigation has located about 200 biosafety level 3 and 4 lab facilities, describes their research and gives you safety records that some labs fought to keep secret.</p>

The primary purposes for CDC’s high-containment lab work is to provide better, faster or more sensitive detection methods, and to conduct tests on specimens from patients to determine whether multiple infections are part of an outbreak or unrelated, the agency said. Molecular analysis of specimens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis can determine their resistance to drugs and whether a specific strain is becoming pervasive in a particular area.

Agents being studied in the BSL-3 labs include those that cause tuberculosis, as well as two select agent pathogens: Eastern equine encephalitis virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, said spokesman Jim Bakken. The research focuses on understanding the pathogens and developing vaccines and therapeutics to protect against disease, he said. 
The university has additional BSL-3 labs in two other buildings on campus for work with HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, Bakken said.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Southern Research Institute, with facilities in Alabama, Maryland and North Carolina, provides research services to industry and the federal government, according to its website. Its labs in Birmingham, Ala., and Frederick, Md., each have BSL-3 facilities capable of working with a wide range of pathogens, including select agents. The animal BSL-3 lab in Birmingham has an aerosol inhalation suite that can be used for vaccine and drug-effectiveness studies, including for select agents. According to minutes of the institute’s biosafety committee, released in response to a request from USA TODAY, experiments in recent years have involved SARS and MERS viruses, influenza strains and development of a vaccine against Lassa fever, but it is unclear which pathogens are researched at which facility. “As for specific projects in which we’re currently involved, this information is proprietary, and confidentiality agreements with both our government and commercial clients prohibit us from disseminating project details,” institute spokesperson Rossi Morris said in an email. In general, Morris said, the institute can support preclinical vaccine studies for influenza, HIV/AIDS, SARS, smallpox and other pathogens. Morris said there were no NIH-reportable lab incidents at the Maryland and Alabama facilities from Jan. 1, 2012, through Dec. 12, 2014, when the institute responded to USA TODAY’s records request. The non-profit, tax-exempt organization was founded in 1941. It had more than $81.6 million in revenue in 2012, according to the group’s federal non-profit tax return.</p>

The Arkansas Public Health lab does not track BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories in the state.  
“If an exposure to an infectious agent occurred in our laboratory, we would work with the state epidemiologist, other infectious-disease doctors in ADH and the appropriate federal regulatory agencies,” Krell said.

The state health department does not track what labs in the state have BSL-3 or BSL-4 capabilities and licenses only environmental laboratories, she said. The state health department also has no regulations requiring the reporting of laboratory incidents involving dangerous pathogens. Although lab incidents involving federally regulated select agents must be reported to the Federal Select Agent Program, Oxley said those reports are not shared with the state health department.

        <p class="byline"> by Paul Giblin</p> 
        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Northern Arizona University has a single bio-safety level 3 suite on its main campus in Flagstaff. Researchers study anthrax, plague, tularemia, brucellosis, Q fever, valley fever, tuberculosis, melioidosis and glanders, said lab director Paul Keim. “We are trying to understand the biology of the pathogens, including their evolution and ecology. The goal is to fight them through epidemiology, diagnostics, vaccines and new drugs,” he said. The lab is registered to work with “select agents” and conducts genome analysis of anthrax, plague and other agents.
A lab that federal officials would only describe as an “Arizona research university” agreed in 2014 to pay a $165,000 fine for failing to keep accurate inventory records for select agents and not having biosafety procedures adequate for the risks associated with the pathogens in its possession. Keim confirmed the university was NAU. 
Settlement documents obtained under the federal Freedom of Information Act provide little information about the specifics of the violations or the kinds of pathogens involved. Keim said the university had difficulty keeping up with emerging federal regulations concerning anthrax and other agents. At the direction of the CDC, the university shut its lab for three months in 2010 to correct its inventory accounting issues. As part of its corrective measures, the university hired two new staffers to focus exclusively on record-keeping and compliance matters, he said. Since then, NAU has passed several inspections, including surprise inspections. “We’ve been perfect ever since,” Keim said.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Arizona State University has two BSL-3 suites and one ABSL-3 suite on its main campus in Tempe. Mark Johnson, senior director for media relations, said ASU is involved in infectious-disease research to develop vaccines and therapeutics to mitigate the leading causes of worldwide morbidity and mortality. The lab works with Ebola, HIV/AIDS, West Nile virus, pneumonia and other pathogens. A portion of the university’s research is conducted in BSL-3 labs, specifically work with Yersinia pestis, monkeypox virus, HIV, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  Projects include development of a live attenuated vaccine against Yersinia pestis; study of monkeypox virus virulence and how it interacts with a host’s antiviral defenses; vaccine development for tuberculosis and HIV; and developing a model for studying chronic viral infections and a vaccine for Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body"> “The State Public Health Laboratory on the Richmond campus has three BSL-3 laboratories for routine work with infectious diseases,” said Mervyn Perera of the California Department of Public Health. “In addition, California has 14 laboratories at the county government level that participate in the CDC-sponsored Laboratory Response Network. These labs are used on a regular basis and also have BSL-3 capacity. 
The department has authority to license and inspect human clinical laboratories but does not certify BSL-3 or BSL-4 labs, nor does it have a way to determine which labs operate at those containment levels, Perera said.
“While the CDPH does not receive notification of all laboratory-associated incidents statewide, the department does have a complaint process,” Perera said, noting that all entities that possess select agents must register with federal select-agent officials.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Global pharmaceutical company Allergan has a BSL-3 facility at its Irvine, Calif., location, according to information posted online in company employees’ profiles and a design firm with staff who were involved in its construction.
Botox, Allergan’s blockbuster prescription medication for issues ranging from wrinkles and chronic migraine to overactive bladder and urinary incontinence, is made from botulinum toxin that is injected in small doses to paralyze certain muscles or block nerves. 
BSL-3 precautions are recommended for work with large quantities of botulinum neurotoxins, as well as any activities that may create droplets or sprays, according to laboratory guidelines set by the federal government.
The toxin, produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria, can cause botulism, a life-threatening type of food poisoning. It is considered a potential bioterror weapon. The Federal Select Agent Program lists botulinum neurotoxins and species of Clostridium that produce them to be “Tier 1” pathogens – considered to pose a high risk and that require greater levels of protection against insider threats that could lead to theft or release.
Allergan officials would not grant interviews or answer questions about the company’s BSL-3 labs or regulation of its facilities by the Federal Select Agent Program, despite repeated requests since November 2014. “Thanks for the inquiry but we are not able to participate,” said company spokeswoman Bonnie Jacobs in a November 2014 email. In January 2015, spokeswoman Cathy Taylor again refused to answer questions and instead issued a general statement saying Allergan is proud of its manufacturing practices and that it “maintains an unparalleled compliance record.” 
Certain jobs at Allergan require the employee “to work in areas requiring select agent access” and have a “strong understanding of CDC select agent requirements,” according to two recent job listings for scientists and manufacturing logistics staff the company posted on the career networking site LinkedIn. “Violation of, or failing to support the intent of select agent policies, regulations or laws can result in substantial fines and/or imprisonment,” notes one job posting for a principal scientist.
Botulinum toxins pose “a major threat” as biological weapons that could be aerosolized or involve contamination of the food or water supply, according to the UPMC Center for Health Security in Baltimore, an independent think tank that studies policy issues relating to biosecurity issues, epidemics and disasters.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The University of California-Irvine has two BSL-3 labs on its Irvine campus and one of them is registered to work with select agents, said Tom Vasich, director of research communications. As of April 2015, the select-agent lab was closed for renovations and maintenance, he said. Research in the other BSL-3 lab includes work with HIV and West Nile virus for purposes of the development of vaccines, diagnostics and treatments.
The university also has a BSL-3 lab at the UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange that is used only for clinical diagnoses and not for research.
As a condition of its federal research funding, the University of California-Irvine is required under the NIH Guidelines to provide copies of its Institutional Biosafety Committee’s records to the public on request. The NIH has issued guidance to labs suggesting they make the records available on the Web. On Nov. 5, 2014, USA TODAY filed a written request with the university, citing the NIH Guidelines, and asked for copies of the committee’s minutes and any lab incidents reported to the National Institutes of Health.
The university did not release any records until Feb. 4, 2015 – and the most recent records it provided were from a meeting that had occurred five months earlier, in September 2014. In emails, the university’s public records coordinator, Eric Digman, said that the request was processed in compliance with the California Public Records Act and that he had released all records available at the time USA TODAY made its request three months earlier. 
After USA TODAY filed a formal complaint with the National Institutes of Health about the university’s processing delays and the refusal to release more recent records, the university on Feb. 28, 2015, released additional documents dated Oct. 8, 2014, through Jan. 21, 2015. In a March 2015 letter to USA TODAY, NIH officials said: “We contacted the University for an explanation of why this request took so long to fulfill. The University attributed this delay to multiple factors including the volume of public records requests the institution was processing at the time, as well as the fact that the University was closed for two public holidays while attempting to fulfill the request. The University of California-Irvine also provided us with specific mitigation measures they are taking to avoid such delays in the future, such as prioritizing NIH Guidelines requests over other public records requests so that requests are fulfilled quickly.” 
The records released by the university include a January 2012 incident report that involved three transgenic mice escaping in December 2011 from defective disposable caging in an animal BSL-3 lab suite. “The mice were transgenic, expressing the human or human-elk chimeric prion protein, and had been inoculated with brain homogenates from deer/elk or humans infected with chronic wasting disease or human Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,” the incident records say. Despite a search of all the rooms in the suite, the mice weren’t initially found. Then a worker noticed Styrofoam crumbs under a holding-room door. The door, which had a Styrofoam interior core, was removed and the three mice were found inside, the report says. The animals were put into new cages.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The Scripps Research Institute, a non-profit biomedical research organization, operates a BSL-3 facility at its headquarters campus in La Jolla, according to heavily redacted minutes of the organization’s Institutional Biosafety Committee.
Scripps attorney Kevin Cahill, in response to questions from USA TODAY, said in an email that the La Jolla campus has three BSL-3 suites plus an additional three animal BSL-3 suites. Pathogens used in various research projects in those labs include a replication-deficient Ebola variant, Neisseria meningitis, HIV, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease brain tissue and a vancomycin-resistant strain of Enterococcus faecalis.
Although The Scripps Research Institute has previously been registered to work with federally regulated select agents and has done such work in the past, the organization’s California and Florida facilities “are not currently” registered to work with them, Cahill said.
During 2013 and 2014, safety committee minutes show discussion of a research project involving genetically modified Ebola specimens and using BSL-3 containment practices.
The purpose of the research was “to test the effects of structure suggested mutations on the virus life-cycle,” according to the August 2013 minutes. “The project will be at BSL-3+, which will include segregation of the agent to its own suite and the removal of outer PPE (booties and gloves) within the BSL-3 facility prior to exiting the suite to the dirty corridor,” the minutes say. “The lab members will receive project specific BSL-3 training prior to being granted access to the facility.” The minutes note that the biosafety committee called for testing of the specimens to ensure the absence of a certain gene.
In September 2014, the safety committee discussed an additional Ebola project proposed by the same researcher. “The BSL-3+ suite used for the project is segregated and restricted to use for this project,” the minutes say, noting that access is restricted with a traceable ID code and hands-on training is required before access is granted. “The virus is non-viable and recombination of the virus has never been documented. … Intentional regeneration of the virus was discussed.”
Cahill said the Ebola variants used in the research are “replication incompetent,” which means they can’t be duplicated, replicated or regenerated and there is “no potential” for intentional regeneration of those viruses, he said.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory operates a facility with three BSL-3 laboratories, according to an audit published in August 2014 by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Inspector General’s Office.
Lab spokesman Steve Wampler said the labs are used for research relating to medical countermeasures and detection methods. The lab is registered to work with select agents, he said. Current work with anthrax seeks to develop a vaccine, he said.
Minutes of the lab’s biosafety committee minutes, released under the federal Freedom of Information Act, indicate work in recent years with ricin, anthrax and MERS. But the minutes are often written in a way that makes them difficult to decipher without access to other documents that weren’t publicly released.
For example, minutes from a June 10, 2014, meeting indicate discussion of a new application for research involving “Genetic characterization of risk group 3 viruses.” But almost nothing is disclosed in the minutes about the substance of the project. The minutes say: “A review of the new project was given by the RI. The following changes were requested” and then it lists four changes that reference a document that wasn’t released. Those changes say things such as “A.2.9 add isolates and source,” and “A.3.1 change viral to MERS” and “A.7.3 add language that materials will be shipped from the university in Trizol.”
A 2005 incident involving one of the lab’s scientists resulted in a $450,000 federal fine of the lab’s operator after packages of anthrax specimens were sent to other labs in Florida and Virginia and some of the vials were uncapped, according to a Department of Homeland Security report. “There have been no safety or handling issues involving biological materials/agents since 2005,” Wampler said. 
The 2014 inspector general’s audit raised concerns about whether the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory accurately tracks how much its BSL-3 labs are used and whether they could be used to perform work for other agencies. “The data regarding actual utilization rates of LLNL’s BSL-3 laboratories was not readily available,” the audit said. “LLNL asserted that its BSL-3 laboratories were over utilized and did not have the capacity for additional work; however, LLNL did not have data to support its projected biosafety laboratory utilization rates.”

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">UCLA has two BSL-3 facilities equipped to work with select agents, said Tod Tamberg of UCLA’s office of media relations. Both BSL-3 facilities are part of UCLA’S High Containment Program and the research there is focused on ways to rapidly detect, treat and prevent infectious diseases, Tamberg said. Ongoing research includes identifying targets for the development of improved countermeasures against Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei, Tamberg said. Additional pathogens of interest include Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Francisella tularensis, the agents of tuberculosis and tularemia, respectively.  “Our emphasis is on developing vaccines with greater efficacy and safety than currently available vaccines,” Tamberg said. The researchers also are developing nanotherapeutics designed to target and carry antibiotics into infected cells.  </p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The Naval Health Research Center, located at the Naval Base Point Loma, opened a BSL-3 lab in late 2009 in response to concerns about the H5N1 avian influenza virus, according to an article published in a scientific journal by several Army scientists in 2011.
Cmdr. Gary Brice, director of operational infectious-disease research at the center, said in a recent interview that while the BSL-3 facility was commissioned, it was never used at that containment level. “We have never used any BSL-3 agents, including H5N1, in that building,” he said. The facility has been used only for BSL-2 work, he said.
In September 2013, the Navy sought bids for an architectural and engineering assessment of the BSL-3 lab, which it was planning to renovate in accordance with current federal requirements, federal contracting documents show. The Navy sought a report and architectural plans to do several tasks, including:
1. “Rewelding and repair of the HVAC ducts on the second floor. The lack of welding in this duct can cause the release of infectious agents to the environment.”
2. “Add two surveillance cameras inside the bio-containment unit due to the presence of blind spots.”
3. “Install duress alarm buttons in various areas of the laboratory.”
The plans for the assessment and renovations were postponed shortly after they were posted online “due to issues with funding,” records show.
Brice said that the center had sought the architectural and engineering assessment to make the lab ready, if needed, to address emerging microbial threats, such as MERS.</p>

One of the labs is an animal core facility, located in the Hunters Point area of San Francisco, 3 miles from the main UCSF campus. The facility contains about 8,000 rodents (mice and rats). About 40 of those animals are kept in ABSL-3 containment. The Gladstone Institutes, a non-profit research wing that reports to UCSF, operates BSL-3 labs at its location adjacent to UCSF’s Mission Bay campus. UCSF conducts research at the genetic, cellular, molecular and systems level to identify new ways to diagnose, treat and prevent a variety of disorders, Bole wrote. Those include HIV, tuberculosis, serious fungal infections and devastating forms of dementia and neurodegenerative diseases. The university is registered to work with select agents in a BSL-2 facility, which is developing therapies to neutralize neurotoxins.</p>

Michals would not say what pathogens are used in research at the facilities.
SRI redacted the names of many pathogens from minutes of its Institutional Biosafety Committee, which oversees research at both sites, before releasing them to USA TODAY. The firm said it could not disclose the names of pathogens used in its research that are designated as select agents, because of their potential for use as bioweapons. Yet on its website and in press releases, SRI International has touted its research involving several select agents, including anthrax, plague, tularemia and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, as well as ricin, botulinum toxins and abrin, a poison.
SRI International had more than $566 million in revenue during 2012, according to its most recent non-profit tax return posted on Guidestar, an online website that collects tax returns from IRS-registered non-profit groups.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Global pharmaceutical company Allergan has a BSL-3 facility at its Campbell, Calif., location, according to information posted online by XL Construction. The construction firm lists Allergan’s quality-control laboratories, including “BSL 3 laboratory space” among project work it has done at the facility.
Botox, Allergan’s blockbuster prescription medication for issues ranging from wrinkles and chronic migraine to overactive bladder and urinary incontinence, is made from botulinum toxin that is injected in small doses to paralyze certain muscles or block nerves. 
BSL-3 precautions are recommended for work with large quantities of botulinum neurotoxins, as well as any activities that may create droplets or sprays, according to laboratory guidelines set by the federal government.
The toxin, produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria, can cause botulism, a life-threatening type of food poisoning. It is considered a potential bioterror weapon. The Federal Select Agent Program lists botulinum neurotoxins and species of Clostridium that produce them to be “Tier 1” pathogens – considered to pose a high risk and that require greater levels of protection against insider threats that could lead to theft or release.
Allergan officials would not grant interviews or answer questions about the company’s BSL-3 labs or regulation of its facilities by the Federal Select Agent Program, despite repeated requests since November. “Thanks for the inquiry but we are not able to participate,” said company spokeswoman Bonnie Jacobs in a November 2014 email. In January 2015, spokeswoman Cathy Taylor, again refused to answer questions and instead issued a general statement saying Allergan is proud of its manufacturing practices and that it “maintains an unparalleled compliance record.”

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">National Jewish Health operates one BSL-3 research laboratory and one BLS-3 clinical laboratory on its main campus in Denver, said William Allstetter, director of media and external relations for the organization. The research lab conducts research on mycobacteria including tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacterial disease, and the clinical lab conducts diagnostic tests for mycobacterial disease. University officials declined to discuss what types of pathogens they work with on campus but said the work generally concerns vaccines. The university, through Allstetter, also declined to discuss the select agents it works with, saying “the FBI would be quite displeased if we did” disclose that information.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The U.S. Department of Agriculture operates a BSL-3 suite at its National Wildlife Research Center. The small lab suite is used for wildlife disease research, said spokeswoman Gail Keirn, and the pathogens studied there have included West Nile virus and a low-pathogenic H5N8 strain of avian influenza.
The H5N8 study examined whether rock doves are a potential carrier of the strain, Keirn said. West Nile virus research has included evaluating whether bird lice are a reservoir for the virus and also studying whether raccoons are a reservoir for the virus.
As the research arm of the wildlife services program of USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, scientists at the facility do work relating to wildlife damage management problems that impact agriculture, natural resources, property and human health.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has 12 operational BSL-3 labs in Fort Collins, where work focuses on vector-borne diseases – those transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks, fleas and other carriers – such as Francisella tularensis, the agency said in response to questions from USA TODAY. The lab is registered to work with select agents.
The primary purposes for CDC’s high-containment lab work is to provide better, faster or more sensitive detection methods, or to conduct tests on specimens from patients to determine whether multiple infections are part of an outbreak or unrelated, the agency said. Molecular analysis of specimens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis can determine their resistance to drugs and whether a specific strain is becoming pervasive in a particular area.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Colorado State University has BSL-3 and ABSL-3 labs at its Main Campus, South Campus and Foothills Campus – all in Fort Collins, Communications Coordinator Jeff Dodge said. Much of the labs’ work focuses on creating vaccine candidates for tuberculosis; the university has worked on more than 200 over the past 12 years.  Other projects study how diseases interact with animal hosts and how their immune systems protect them from pathogens that are dangerous to humans. Examples include West Nile virus transmitted by mosquitoes and MERS-Coronavirus in camels, Dodge said.  The labs are registered to work with select agents. 
In October 2014, a safety worker at the university was bitten by a mosquito while in a laboratory adjoining an insectary where genetically modified mosquitoes were being used in a dengue virus experiment, according to an incident report the university filed with the National Institutes of Health. “The person did not find the mosquito, nor did others who searched the lab area for several hours, and over the period of 3 days,” the report said, adding that it “is unlikely that the mosquito which caused the bite was infected with any virus.” The worker was tested for dengue virus antibodies after the bite and again three weeks later but showed no signs of exposure, the report said.
In May 2014, a worker in a BSL-3 lab failed to make sure specimens of Burkholderia pseudomallei had been killed before shipping samples – some still able to grow – to another lab where a worker handled them without key protective gear, according to an incident report to the NIH. The bacterium is classified as a “Tier 1” select agent because it poses a “severe threat to public health and safety.” Nobody was sickened in the incident, the university said.
The minutes from the university’s biosafety committee note repeated inspections – in July 2013 and in September 2013 by officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which jointly run the Federal Select Agent Program. A biosafety officer for the university told the committee “we finally received the inspection report on January 7, 2014. … One of the main items they had was in regards to the Suitability Assessment Program. This program is up and running, however we have to tell CDC why everyone will not be through it by April 1st,&#34; according to minutes of the February 2014 meeting. According to the Federal Select Agent Program’s website, suitability assessments involve checks labs need to make to determine the “integrity and trustworthiness” of individuals working with potential bioterror pathogens to reduce the risk of insider threats that they’ll be intentionally misused. 
In April 2014, the committee’s minutes say: “The administrative burden of the Select Agent regulations was also discussed. The BSO has tried to take on most of the burden for the Select Agent requirements; which is why another ABSO was hired. It was suggested by a committee member that CSU should band together with other universities to challenge the CDC in an effort to try to get them to relax these regulations.”
Colorado State initially tried to charge $340 for copies of its Institutional Biosafety Committee minutes and related incident reports – and it blacked out the names of certain pathogens involved in research and mishaps. 
“You really think $340 is excessive? Yikes,” Linda Schutjer, a senior legal counsel for the university, wrote in a Nov. 19, 2014, email after USA TODAY objected to the fee as excessive. Schutjer said it took the university 17 hours to gather and review the records, even though it is required under the NIH Guidelines to make them available to anyone who asks as a condition of its federal research funding. After a series of emails, the university waived the fees.
But when the university released the records, USA TODAY discovered blacked-out names of certain pathogens. The newspaper again filed a series of objections with the university, noting that Colorado State publicizes on its website that its scientists work with what appeared to be many of the redacted pathogens. 
The university, in a Nov. 21, 2014, email, said it redacted names of select agents because of “security concerns” and that the decision to do this was based on consultation with “an expert” at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Yet a spokesman for the CDC, Jason McDonald, told USA TODAY: “With the exception of specific security information (such as IT system passwords, key locations and lock combinations), the select agent regulations place no restrictions on the releasing [of] information related to select agents or toxins by regulated entities.” 
After USA TODAY shared McDonald’s statement with the university and said the newspaper would be filing a formal NIH Guidelines violation complaint, Schutjer on Dec. 4, 2014, released another set of records that restored names of the pathogens.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Yale University operates two BSL-3 facilities on its main campus in New Haven but is not now registered to work with select agents, said Thomas Conroy, spokesman for the college.
Risk group 3 pathogens, such as West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, HIV and Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus are studied at Yale for vaccine research, immunobiology studies and viral attachment, Conroy said.
“We did have a proposal to work with highly pathogenic Avian influenza virus, but this research protocol was pulled by the researcher and never pursued,” Conroy said. 
Minutes of the college’s biosafety committee meetings for the past two years make references to a new BSL-3/ABSL-3 facility and labs authorized for BSL-3 experiments.
In 2013 and 2014, Yale filed eight incident reports with NIH. Five concerned accidental needle sticks. Two were about research done without proper authorization, and another entailed the spill of a defective lentiviral vector from a sealed rotor during a centrifuge run on Nov. 7, 2013.
No illnesses or adverse effects were reported by any individuals in the incidents reported to NIH, said Conway.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The Public Health Laboratory of Washington, D.C., opened the first BSL-3 laboratory in the nation’s capital in 2013. It operates as part of the Department of Forensic Sciences, said Keith St. Clair, director of communications for the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety and Justice in D.C. The department operates two BSL-3 lab suites. One facility is the primary lab housed within the Consolidated Forensic Laboratory in southwest D.C. The other is a backup, located at an off-site location, also in D.C. The second lab would be used in the event the main lab becomes unusable. The department does not perform research in the lab; it does diagnostic work involving alleged or suspected select agents and toxins, including possible events of bioterrorism, St. Clair said. The BSL-3 is used to handle clinical samples from patients suspected of carrying highly infectious diseases such as Ebola. The lab is certified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to handle select agents and joined 10 existing labs nationwide as “surge capacity” labs for the CDC. These labs comprise a “front-line defense” to respond to bioterrorism, chemical terrorism and other public health emergencies.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The University of Florida operates at least seven BSL-3 spaces at its Emerging Pathogens Institute on the campus in Gainesville, according to a university website. The 80,000-square-foot facility has four BSL-3 suites and three BSL-3 rooftop greenhouses. Janine Sikes, a university spokeswoman, declined to answer questions about how many labs are on campus and whether the university is registered to work with select agents. Sikes said areas of research include the study of vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus and dengue, influenza, tuberculosis, food-borne illnesses such as cholera, plant pathogens such as citrus greening, and antibiotic resistance infections including MRSA. The main objectives of the research is to preserve health and to prevent or contain new and re-emerging diseases. A recent example is the work of Ira Longini Jr., a professor of biostatistics, who is part of the World Health Organization team working on an Ebola vaccine, Sikes said.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The Scripps Research Institute, a non-profit biomedical research organization headquartered in California, operates BSL-3 facilities at its Florida campus, according to heavily redacted minutes of the organization’s Institutional Biosafety Committee.
Scripps attorney Kevin Cahill, in response to questions from USA TODAY, said in an email that the Florida campus has one BSL-3 suite and one animal BSL-3 suite that are used for work with pathogens such as HIV and bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
Although The Scripps Research Institute has previously been registered to work with federally regulated select agents and has done such work in the past, the organization’s California and Florida facilities “are not currently” registered to work with them, Cahill said.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">MRIGlobal does chemical, biological and explosives defense work for the U.S. Department of Defense, other federal agencies and clients in facilities that include a bioaerosol test chamber, where detection and sampling devices and air filtration systems for bacteria and viruses can be tested. In 2013, MRIGlobal was awarded a contract worth up to $11.96 million to develop tests for the diagnosis of anthrax, plague and tularemia in people suspected of being infected, federal records show. The organization is registered to work with select agents, according to its brochures. In Palm Bay, Fla., the firm has a 52,000-square-foot facility that includes BSL-3 labs. The Florida facility focuses on biodefense programs and evaluation of detection equipment, according to one of its brochures. William Bailey, the firm’s manager for quality and regulatory systems, declined to answer USA TODAY’s questions about the firm’s research at individual facilities and what pathogens it involves. He referred a reporter to the organization’s website. Bailey said MRIGlobal is not required to make public the minutes of its Institutional Biosafety Committee’s meetings because the recombinant DNA work the company has done in recent years is exempt from NIH Guidelines that would require disclosure. MRIGlobal is a private, not-for-profit organization founded in 1944 as Midwest Research Institute, its website says. It has operations in nine states and the District of Columbia, according to its website. It has BSL-3 lab facilities in Kansas City, Mo.; Palm Bay, Fla.; and Rockville, Md. The organization had nearly $100 million in revenue during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, according to its federal non-profit tax return.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, operated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, researches exotic, emerging and endemic poultry diseases to improve diagnosis, prevention and control. The facility includes BSL-3 facilities, records show, and has worked with such pathogens as avian influenza, West Nile virus and Newcastle disease.
During separate incidents in June and September 2014, USDA staff working around select-agent strains of avian influenza in BSL-3 labs here were potentially exposed to the virus when they experienced equipment failures of air-purifying respirators, according to incident information obtained by USA TODAY under the Freedom of Information Act.
In the September incident, an animal caretaker noticed decreased airflow to their respirator and discovered a hose had separated from its coupling. The animal caretaker was put on antiviral medication for 10 days and told to monitor daily for development of a fever. No infection resulted, the records say. The manufacturer of the protective breathing gear replaced all the hoses at the lab, and lab officials required all hoses to have their joints reinforced with tape. 
In June 2014, another employee experienced reduced airflow through an air-purifying respirator while taking samples from ducks involved in an avian influenza experiment. In that case, a tear was discovered in the breathing tube. All staff using BSL-3 facilities were retrained on proper assembly and inspection of personal protective equipment. In addition, the lab added a clear hose cover to the tubes for additional protection and latches on 50 poultry cages were replaced after the lab looked for possible snag hazards. The employee in this incident was told to monitor for development of a fever twice daily, plus take a 10-day course of antiviral medication. No infection resulted, the records say.
In another incident, around May 2014, scientists at the lab observed chickens unexpectedly becoming sick and dying in an experiment with a bird flu strain that shouldn’t cause such serious illness. They discovered that what they thought was an H9N2 avian influenza specimen shipped to them by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta had been unknowingly cross-contaminated by the CDC with the deadly H5N1 strain, according to a CDC report of the incident.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has 50 U.S.-based labs that are registered for BSL-3 containment and 36 of them are in Atlanta, the agency said in response to questions from USA TODAY. The agency’s Atlanta headquarters campus also has two suites of BSL-4 labs, the highest containment level, which works with the most dangerous pathogens, including the deadly Ebola virus.  The agency operates other BSL-3 labs in Fort Collins, Colo.; Anchorage, Alaska; and San Juan, Puerto Rico.
The CDC’s labs in Atlanta were involved in several high-profile safety incidents during 2014, prompting a congressional hearing in July and sweeping promises of safety reforms from CDC Director Tom Frieden.  Changes have included procedural reviews, more training, installation of camera systems to better monitor safety protocols, and the hiring of a high-level official to oversee lab safety.
In December 2014, staff in CDC’s elite Viral Special Pathogens Branch working in one of the agency’s BSL-4 suites – where scientists use spacesuit-like, full-body protective gear with respirators filtering the air they breathe – confused two types of specimens of the deadly Ebola virus. Some samples contained live virus that were supposed to stay inside the BSL-4 lab. Others had undergone a kill step to make them safe to send to a BSL-2 lab, where staff generally wear simply gowns and gloves. But the wrong specimens were sent to the lower-level lab and a worker had to undergo 21 days of monitoring for potential Ebola infection but never became ill. 
The CDC’s investigation of the Ebola incident concluded that the specimens sent to the lower-level lab likely never contained any live virus because the samples were taken from animals in an experiment who appeared to have cleared the infection from their bodies. Although the CDC published a report of its internal investigation, the agency denied USA TODAY’s request under the Freedom of Information Act for copies of the incident reports about the mistake, citing laws that exempt from release certain reports involving inspections or releases of potential bioterror pathogens deemed to be select agents. Ebola is listed as a select agent.
In June 2014, dozens of CDC employees were potentially exposed to anthrax after lab staff failed to make sure the spores had been killed before shipping them from a BSL-3 lab to BSL-2 lab that wasn’t equipped to work with the live pathogen. The head of the CDC’s bioterrorism response lab later resigned.
In early 2014, other CDC lab staff mistakenly cross-contaminated a mild strain of avian influenza with a deadly strain, then shipped the contaminated sample to a U.S. Department of Agriculture lab in Athens, Ga. USDA scientists in May 2014 discovered the CDC’s mistake after birds in an experiment unexpectedly died. A CDC investigation concluded sloppy lab practices were to blame. 
USA TODAY has reported for several years about other safety and security lapses at the CDC’s Atlanta labs, including repeated problems with air-flow systems designed to keep infectious agents inside high-containment labs and failures to maintain proper security.  Typically private government audits of CDC labs, obtained by USA TODAY, found the agency’s labs were cited in 2010 and 2009 for failures to provide biosafety training to many staff working in areas with pathogens that have the potential to be used as bioterror agents.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The university operates several high-containment suites at its Atlanta main campus that include one BSL-4, one ABSL-3 and three BSL-3 laboratories. The facility has another two BSL-3 labs not currently in use, Senior Biosafety Officer Richard Muller said. 
The university works with both West Nile virus and herpes B virus, hosting the National B Virus Resource Center that assists with various research projects, including NIH research on HIV and AIDS. The facility’s work with West Nile virus focuses on how the virus and its host interact on a molecular level, which could lead to better treatments and vaccines. Although the laboratories are registered to work with select agents, they weren’t being used in any experiments, Muller said. 
The Government Accountability Office voiced concerns about perimeter security at Georgia State’s BSL-4 lab and one other BSL-4 lab in a 2008 report. The university said in a statement shortly after the report that its labs had “repeatedly and consistently passed all CDC inspections of the containment laboratory according to the CDC Select Agent Regulations.” However, in 2012 the university moved its BSL-4 lab to a building with upgraded security features, Muller said.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Hawaii’s state public health laboratory has BSL-3 suites that are used for BSL-3 training and biological agent threat analysis and to determine whether a submitted specimen is a select agent, said Janice Okubo, communications director for the Hawaii State Department of Health. The BSL-3 lab is also used for BSL-2 work, with full BSL-3 operations occurring once a month, on average.
Hawaii does not maintain a statewide database of BSL-3 labs, however “we are aware of a handful of BSL-3 labs in our state,” Okubo said. Regulatory oversight comes from a number of state or federal authorities including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and USDA. Laboratory tests for many infectious diseases can be monitored electronically by Hawaii’s Disease Outbreak Control Division.

        <div class="hr1"></div>
        <p class="byline"> by Alison Young</p> 
        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The University of Hawaii-Manoa has a BSL-3 lab facility at its John A. Burns School of Medicine, according to the university’s website. Recent research proposed for the university’s BSL-3 labs has included work with West Nile virus, tuberculosis, hantaviruses, Japanese encephalitis virus and Burkholderia pseudomallei bacteria, the university’s biosafety committee records show. As of early 2015, because of violations of Federal Select Agent Program regulations, the university’s labs that work with potential bioterror pathogens were in a federal performance improvement program, according to records obtained by USA TODAY as part of an appeal of the university’s denial of access to records about the sanctions. University officials declined to be interviewed or to answer questions about their high-containment labs. They also wouldn’t discuss or release records relating to why select-agent regulators at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention placed their labs into the performance improvement program. “Thank you for the final opportunity to respond to your inquiries,” wrote university spokeswoman Talia Ogliore in an April 14, 2015, email, “however, the University respectfully declines to provide additional information about our research program and approach.”
USA TODAY has appealed the university’s denial of access to correspondence and other records about regulatory actions taken against its labs. Hawaii’s Office of Information Practices, which received the appeal in January 2015, said it could take a year or longer to make a decision in the case because it has a backlog of appeals.
But in correspondence the university sent to the office in response to USA TODAY’s appeal, the university confirmed its labs had been placed in the select-agent performance improvement program. The university told the information practices agency that it’s “proud” of the research it does “and of entering voluntarily into a performance improvement plan to enhance our program even more. We do not believe entering into the program is an embarrassment, we think it should be showcased, but that would be improper because as participants in the Federal Select Agent Program, we are obligated to keep this information private,” the university wrote to Hawaii’s Office of Information Practices on Jan. 26, 2015. “UH has been an exemplary participant in the Federal Select Agent Program.”
According to the CDC, significant and systemic safety or security violations – not exemplary performance – is what gets a lab a spot in the performance improvement program. While it is a voluntary choice for a lab to enter the program, in response to questions from USA TODAY the CDC said that the alternative would likely be suspension from the select-agent program – and halting of research – until problems are corrected.
The CDC would not comment on the University of Hawaii’s case or what violations were identified at its labs by federal regulators. Since 2008, 33 lab operators that are registered to work with potential bioterror pathogens as part of the Federal Select Agent Program have been put into a performance improvement program, the CDC said. In a letter to Hawaii’s information practices office, university Chancellor Robert Bley-Vroman said that keeping the disciplinary records secret is critical: “We believe that release of this information would present a danger to both national security and the health and welfare of residents of Hawaii.”
Records show the information practices office asked the university whether it’s possible to release any portions of the requested records with specific sensitive information redacted. Such redactions are a common practice under state and federal open records laws. The university said it’s impossible to release anything because the “mere fact that the University of Hawaii is participating in the Federal Select Agent Program” must be kept secret. “None of the information sought is public, it is all information protected by bioterrorism laws.”
Yet the university’s website promotes the work its scientists are doing with pathogens that are select agents, such as Burkholderia pseudomallei, that require participation in the Federal Select Agent Program. “Welcome to the Hoang Lab Website!” says a webpage for Tung Hoang in the University of Hawaii-Manoa’s microbiology department. The page says Hoang’s research focuses on Burkholderia pseudomallei and notes the bacterium is “a CDC category B and potential bioterrorism agent.” A webpage for the university’s department of tropical medicine and medical microbiology notes that key research areas include Burkholderia pseudomallei and Nipah virus, which also is a select agent. The university also uses its website to publicize journal articles – available for anyone to read – that its scientists have published about their research with select-agent pathogens. Although the university said it is prohibited from disclosing its participation in the Federal Select Agent Program, the CDC says that’s not true.
“With the exception of specific security information (such as IT system passwords, key locations and lock combinations), the select agent regulations place no restrictions on the releasing [of] information related to select agents or toxins by regulated entities,” said Jason McDonald, a spokesman for the CDC, which co-runs the Federal Select Agent Program with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
At the USDA, Freeda Isaac, director of Agriculture Select Agent Services, said in a statement: “The CDC and APHIS Federal Select Agent Program has not instructed entities to withhold select agent information from the public.”
A 2002 bioterrorism law prohibits certain named federal agencies from releasing specific information about select-agent labs’ registration records. Yet in guidance to labs, the Federal Select Agent Program has emphasized they are allowed to publicize research with these bioterrorism pathogens. If this were not the case, universities and their scientists would routinely be violating bioterrorism laws each time they publish an article about select-agent research in a scientific journal.
“The select agent regulations place no specific restrictions on the publication of research related to select agents or toxins,” the Federal Select Agent Program says in guidance to labs posted on its website. “However, any records or information systems that could allow an individual to gain access to the select agents or toxins should be safeguarded to prevent unauthorized access, theft, loss, or release of these materials.”
Bley-Vroman, the university’s chancellor, said USA TODAY is “attempting to exploit a loophole” by asking for records directly from the university, according to his January 2015 letter to the information practices office. But Courtney French, an attorney for USA TODAY, told the information office: “The University cannot withhold the information in one context while actively publicizing it in another.” French noted that USA TODAY has never sought any sensitive security information.
In November 2014, a Hawaii television station reported it had obtained a copy of the CDC inspection report of the university’s select-agent labs “which said that UH officials did not conduct simple criminal background checks for some lab workers and didn’t have a procedure to report suspicious or criminal acts to federal and local law enforcement.”
The Hawaii News Now television report said that the CDC’s inspection in May 2014 cited the labs for 30 violations and that the regulators’ report said: “The CDC has significant concerns whether UH Manoa can possess and use select agents and toxins in a manner which protects public health and safety.”
The university released to USA TODAY copies of its Institutional Biosafety Committee minutes and reports of incidents filed with the National Institutes of Health – as required as a condition of federal research funding. But in several places the university has redacted information that appears to involve its regulatory problems with the Federal Select Agent Program.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Animal Disease Center does research on diseases that have economic impacts on the livestock and poultry industries. It has two BSL-3 suites, four animal BSL-3 suites and 13 animal rooms. The center works in its BSL-3 labs with Brucella, Mycobacterium bovis and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, the center said in response to questions from USA TODAY. The purpose of the research is to better understand how the organisms cause disease and to develop vaccines and other tools to prevent disease as well as better tests for disease detection, the agency said. The center is registered to work with select agents.
In response to a Freedom of Information Act request seeking records of lab incidents at the center during 2013 and 2014, the USDA released a list with summary information on 10 incidents. All of those incidents happened in 2014. In June 2014, a lab worker was potentially exposed to Leptospira, a dangerous bacteria, because the person didn’t follow safety procedures. The problems included including not wearing appropriate personal protective equipment and working with the pathogen on an open benchtop instead of inside a biosafety cabinet. Leptospira bacteria cause leptospirosis, a disease of humans and animals that if untreated can result in kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, respiratory problems and sometimes death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In nature, people get leptospirosis generally through contact with soil or water that has been contaminated by urine or body fluids from infected animals. According to the document, there was “no injury” associated with the incident and the employee was retrained on proper lab procedures.
In May 2014, an animal caretaker also was potentially exposed to leptospira when the person removed their face mask and rubbed an eye before washing their hands. The employee was retrained on proper procedures for removing protective equipment and exiting animal containment rooms, the document says. In September 2014, a veterinary medical officer was doing a postmortem examination on a cow with bovine tuberculosis when the person accidentally stabbed the side of their knee with a knife used in the exam. Mycobacterium bovis, the pathogen that causes bovine tuberculosis, can cause disease in humans, according to the CDC. “In people, M. bovis causes TB disease that can affect the lungs, lymph nodes, and other parts of the body,” according to the CDC’s fact sheet, which notes that not everyone infected with the pathogen gets sick. Fewer than 2% of the human TB cases in the United States are caused by M. bovis, the CDC says. The USDA’s document doesn’t say whether the vet was infected, and lists the nature of the injury from the incident only as “Penetrating wound on medial side of knee.”
In separate incidents, two employees were potentially exposed to Brucella abortus. Brucella bacteria can cause brucellosis in people when they have contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products, according to the CDC. Symptoms such as fever, sweats, fatigue and muscle or joint pain can occur from five days to five months after exposure. The disease can be treated with antibiotics and recovery from can take weeks to several months, the CDC says, depending on the severity of the disease, which can result in swelling of the heart, testicle and scrotum area and liver or spleen. In July 2014, an animal caretaker handled bags contaminated with blood from a Brucella-infected animal. “Employees in group were retrained on proper procedures,” the record says. “The employee who handled the bags without gloves has not been allowed access to the animal containment building.” In August 2014, a supervisory veterinary medical officer was stuck in the hand with a needle and potentially exposed to Brucella abortus, the document says.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The University of Iowa refused to disclose the location, nature or number of the biological laboratories it oversees, citing an internal policy and Iowa law that it says allows it to keep the information secret for security-related reasons. Public records, however, show that its Institutional Biosafety Committee regularly approves BLS-3 projects. The facilities focus on pathogens that cause serious disease if inhaled, said Tom Moore, a university spokesman. The research helps to develop therapies and vaccines and sets the stage for responding to future zoonotic infections, Moore said. The university’s facilities work with MERS-CoV, a respiratory illness that was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. It also works with the West Nile virus, a mosquito-borne pathogen, Moore said.</p>

It is used for tuberculosis testing as well as for ruling out or confirming the presence of a select agent in a suspicious specimen. If the presence of a select agent is confirmed, IBL is required to notify specific health officials such as the state epidemiologist. If a sample is indicative of a bioterrorism event, the FBI would be notified.  
Only individuals who have received select-agent biosafety and security training and who have passed a federal background check are allowed to access the BSL-3 suite, Shanahan said.
The Idaho Bureau of Laboratories does not assess safety and security measures of other BSL-3 labs in the state, he said.

Ricketts Laboratory in Argonne, the university said in response to questions from USA TODAY. All are registered to work with select agents. The university has no BSL-3 labs at its Hyde Park campus in Chicago, it said.
Pathogens used in research at the Ricketts Laboratory include Brucella abortus, a bacterium that causes brucellosis. “Our select agent research at the HTRL has led to the discovery of Brucella abortus genes that are required for chronic infection,” the university said in an email. “We have also identified several FDA-approved lead compounds that may serve as novel therapeutics for the treatment of human Brucella infection.”
The lab has an anthrax research program that seeks to map surface components of Bacillus anthracis, which forms spores resistant to heat and disinfection. The research will help identify better drugs and vaccines, the university said.
The lab’s plague research program studies the genes and molecular biology of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes the disease. “In-depth understanding of the biology, virulence and immunology of Yersinia pestis is key to develop strategies to prevent possible outbreaks and create safe vaccines,” the university said.
The lab also researches the H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus. “UC researchers propose that H5N1 viruses can infect many more cell types in the respiratory tract than seasonal viruses and this broad infection contributes to the enhanced virulence of H5N1 viruses,” the university said. “The scientists engineer recombinant H5N1 viruses incapable of replication in particular cell types” to study the impact on their ability to cause disease. The lab said it also does research involving Coxiella burnetii, the bacterium that causes Q fever. According to minutes of the lab’s biosafety committee, the Ricketts Laboratory was inspected by officials from the Federal Select Agent Program in September 2013 for its three-year select-agent registration renewal. “No major deficiencies were found although there were observations, mostly with the written plans regarding language, cross-referencing to plans and standard operating procedures,” the committee’s October 2013 minutes say. “They questioned such issues as how the annual review by the Biological Safety Officer is performed, the manual sign-in required for the vivarium, insider threats and compliance. Formal training for personnel reliability/insider threat will be established. There were concerns regarding the high pathogenic influenza program as this program is just being started,” the minutes say, adding that “those working with the influenza virus will need to sign a quarantine agreement to avoid birds for 5 days after working with the agent. Those utilizing the tissue processing room would also need to do the same.”

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Rush University operates one BSL-3 facility in Chicago, wrote John Pontarelli, a university spokesman. The facility is designed to handle human immunodeficiency virus and similar risk group 3 pathogens, which are agents associated with serious or lethal human disease for which preventive or therapeutic interventions may be available. The university is not registered to work with select agents, Pontarelli wrote.
Gannett and USA TODAY filed a request for incident reports and Institutional Biosafety Committee meeting minutes on Nov. 11, 2014. The request was not answered, and university officials did not provide the records nor respond to repeated requests for updates.
USA TODAY filed a complaint with the National Institutes of Health in April 2015, and the university promptly provided the records a week later. Pontarelli said there was a misunderstanding about which records were requested.

According to Melaney Arnold, Illinois Department of Public Health’s communications manager, the IDPH Chicago lab screens for the acute respiratory illness MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as well as the Ebola virus. 
The department inspects three types of laboratories – clinical, water and dairy testing -- but they are not tracked by their biosafety level. IDPH does not regulate BSL-3 or BSL-4 labs, Arnold said.  
The IDPH laboratory division does not receive notifications of lab-associated incidents or accidents.

The university has several other labs capable of level 3 containment but are not engaged in level 3 research, she said. The university does not disclose the labs’ locations and does not respond to informational requests about what type of pathogens are used in research because of the sensitivity of the topic, Barcomb-Peterson said. A 2003 article published on LJWorld.com said that a BSL-3 lab at the Medical Center in Kansas City is used to study HIV. And a Turner Construction Co. website said the Robert E. Hemenway Life Sciences Innovation Center on the campus, which it helped to build, has BSL-3 labs/research equipment that supports research on biochemistry, molecular biology, toxicology, pharmacology, neurosciences and proteomics. The University of Kansas Medical Center initially tried to charge $295 to release copies of its Institutional Biosafety Committee records, which are required to be made public under the NIH Guidelines as a condition of federal research funding. Despite objections filed with the medical center that the fees were excessive, records custodian Debra Brogden said they were justified. After USA TODAY filed a complaint with the National Institutes of Health about excessive fees being charged by the KU Medical Center and lab officials at the University of Kansas’ main campus in Lawrence, the medical center reduced its fee to $45.</p>

Another BSL-3 lab that was under construction in 2003 was to be used to study the West Nile virus, the article said.
According to information posted on KU’s website, the Multidisciplinary Research Building in Lawrence has BSL-3 lab space. Barcomb-Peterson, in an April 2015 email, said BSL-3 research has not yet occurred at the facility because no grants had been received that require that containment level. The University of Kansas initially tried to charge $99 to release copies of its Institutional Biosafety Committee records, which are required to be made public under the NIH Guidelines as a condition of federal research funding. Despite objections filed with the university that the fees were excessive, records custodian Andy Foat said they were justified. After USA TODAY filed a complaint with the National Institutes of Health about excessive fees being charged by the University of Kansas in Lawrence and also at the KU Medical Center in Kansas City, the university reduced its fee to $45.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Kansas State University operates one BSL-3 facility – known as the Biosecurity Research Institute – that houses laboratory research space approved for studies on pathogens of significance to agriculture, food security and human health, said Jeffery Morris, the school’s vice president of communications and marketing. The facility is a singular, secure biocontainment facility located on the main campus of the university in Manhattan. Scientists at the facility do research on food biohazards; how the exotic bluetongue virus interacts with insects and animals; and evaluations of Rift Valley Fever diagnostic tests, which is a project with the USDA’s Arthropod-Borne Animal Diseases Research Unit. Kansas State is registered for work with select agents and has active select-agent research ongoing in compliance with federal, state and local regulations and guidelines, Morris said.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The University of Kentucky operates one BSL-3/ABSL-3 laboratory, registered with the select-agent program, on its campus in Lexington, said Kathy Johnson, a university spokeswoman. University officials initially declined to answer questions about the lab, citing &#34;federally mandated biosecurity measures” and said that the information would “compromise the security of our facilities and the people who work there.” However, the university confirmed the lab’s existence after being shown publicly available references to the work there. The University of Louisville makes reference to the BSL-3 lab in Lexington in an online forum about its two labs located in Louisville. A 2014 grant document for researcher Jacqueline Fetherston makes reference to Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of pneumonic and bubonic plague, which is considered a potential bioterrorism agent. Y. pestis is considered a select agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The University of Louisville has two BSL-3 facilities in Louisville that work with various viruses and bacteria, the university said in emailed answers to questions from USA TODAY. The university is registered to work with select agents and the purpose of the university’s research is to better understand bacterial and viral pathogens and to develop vaccines and treatments.
According to minutes of the university’s biosafety committee’s meetings, research discussed during 2014 includes studies involving Yersinia pestis, the organism that causes plague, and hantaviruses.
In September 2014, the National Institutes of Health contacted the University of Louisville after a whistle-blower alleged the university had failed to report lab incidents as required under the NIH Guidelines, according to records obtained under the federal Freedom of Information Act. In response, the university told NIH that it discovered three incidents that were not reported to NIH but should have been, the records show.
One incident involved a study with transgenic mouse bone marrow stem cells that was performed between 2010 and 2014 without approval of the university’s Institutional Biosafety Committee. Although the issue appears to have been discovered by the university and the project given biosafety committee approval in March 2014, the incident wasn’t reported to NIH until after federal officials opened their inquiry, the records show.
A second incident involved a study using adenovirus vectors that was performed in 2011 and 2012 without biosafety committee review or approval – and only was discovered after the university’s biosafety staff reviewed the researcher’s publication list as part of a separate project. “The biosafety specialist and biological safety officer contacted the investigator in September 2014 and he acknowledged the research was done without IBC approval,” according to a letter NIH sent to the university in November 2014.The third incident involved a human gene transfer trial for pancreatic cancer that continued even though its biosafety committee approval had lapsed.
The NIH closed its inquiry after the university answered the agency’s questions, filed reports on the previously unreported incidents and agreed to take actions to ensure better reporting in the future. “In correspondence with our office, the University of Louisville has stated that these incidents were not reported to our office because certain staff were unaware of the reporting requirements,” the NIH said in response to USA TODAY’s questions. “In investigating the incident, we did not find any evidence of willful non-compliance.”

        <p class="byline"> by Alison Young</p> 
        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The LSU AgCenter has two BSL-3 laboratories, said Mike Durham, the university’s environmental safety director. He declined to say what kinds of pathogens are studied in the labs. A USA TODAY investigation found that the LSU AgCenter is the unnamed university that lab regulators from the Federal Select Agent Program claimed in a June 2009 report to Congress had been fined $425,000 – which if true would be among the largest fines imposed in the program’s history. Records obtained with state and federal open records requests show the fine was never imposed, even though federal investigators documented serious violations at LSU. Violations included the release of a dangerous bacterium from an LSU research facility that resulted in the infection of a cow in an adjacent disease-free herd; after the experiments, 27 cows infected with the bacteria were sent to an unapproved slaughter facility and their meat was sold commercially for human consumption. According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fact sheet on the bacterium, people are most at risk of exposure from consuming raw or unpasteurized dairy products, but the agency advises against eating undercooked meat.
The bacterium involved in the violations was Brucella abortus, which causes a contagious disease called brucellosis that can be economically devastating to the cattle industry. The disease, which is primarily a threat to cattle, bison, elk and deer, can cause pregnant animals to abort fetuses and result in reduced milk production, weight loss, infertility and lameness, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Brucella can also sicken people, causing fever, fatigue, muscle and joint pain and other symptoms that may last “for prolonged periods of time,” according to the CDC. Brucella abortus and two other species of the bacterium are on the U.S. government’s list of select agents because they pose a serious threat to agriculture and have the potential to be turned into bioweapons. In October 2007, during annual testing of LSU’s herd of Crossbred/Brahman cattle, which had been certified as being Brucella-free, a 5-year-old cow branded with number “1922” tested positive for the infection, a USDA investigation report obtained under the federal Freedom of Information Act shows. Tests by the USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratory would later confirm that the cow was infected with Brucella abortus and, specifically, that it was a subtype called “biovar 1 strain 2308” –the same strain used in LSU’s research, according to the USDA’s records and a report of the state agriculture department’s investigation.
The Brahman herd was part of a breeding program at LSU’s Ben Hur Farm that studies ways to improve beef cattle – and was not subject to any disease-related experiments. But the herd was kept in a 50-acre pasture adjacent to an LSU research facility. At the time the Brahman cow No. 1922 was infected, the research facility was doing experiments to test the effectiveness of a commercial Brucella vaccine by exposing cows in the project to the same Brucella abortus biovar 1 strain 2308, records show.
The 30-year-old facility where LSU did its Brucella research was open to the outdoors but included fencing and buffer zones to keep animals involved in experiments away from those in the adjacent Brahman herd. The LSU AgCenter, which says it halted its select-agent research after the incident was discovered, was building a high-security animal isolation facility at the time of the incident.
Brucella bacteria are shed by infected animals in milk and in the aborted fetus, afterbirth and other reproductive tract discharges. Animals are infected through direct contact with infected animals, their fluids or discharges, as well as through contaminated water or feed. The disease cannot be cured and since 1934 federal and state vaccination and surveillance efforts have sought to eliminate the disease. Louisiana achieved brucellosis-free status in 2000, according to the state agriculture department.
The discovery of the Brucella-infected cow at LSU’s Baton Rouge facility caused significant concern among state officials, who mobilized to stop a potential outbreak. They began tracing animals sold out of the LSU herd during the previous year, identifying all cattle herds within a mile of the LSU facility and creating plans to increase testing, records show.
Despite investigations by LSU, the USDA, as well as state agriculture and wildlife officials, it was never determined how cow No. 1922 became exposed to the research strain of the bacterium. Henry Moreau, the Louisiana state veterinarian at the time, said: “It is my opinion that the release of this organism had to be by way of placental fluids or tissues. Direct contact between infected animals and what is now the quarantined herd is almost impossible. Waste water release, transmission by humans, and other less likely routes were also discounted,” according to the Louisiana agriculture department’s report on the incident. Recommendations were made, among other things, to put netting over pens housing infected animals to minimize the chance that infected tissue might be removed by large birds.
While investigating the infected Brahman in the breeding herd, the USDA discovered that cattle exposed to and infected with Brucella abortus in the research program had repeatedly been sent to a slaughter plant in Plaquemine, La., that was not registered with the Federal Select Agent Program to accept experimental animals exposed to the highly regulated pathogen. “The resulting meat product from the slaughter of these animals was sold for human consumption,” the USDA’s investigation report says.
The people involved in slaughtering the experimental cows, because of their potential exposure to infectious fluids, were likely more at risk than those who ultimately ate meat from the animals, according to federal advice to hunters on protecting themselves against contracting brucellosis from wild hogs, bison, elk and caribou, which can also carry the disease. The advice on CDC’s website instructs hunters to take precautions while butchering and to “thoroughly cook meat from any animal that can get brucellosis.”
In July 2008, the USDA notified LSU that the federal investigation had found the university violated select-agent regulations by transferring cattle infected with Brucella abortus to the slaughter plant and by failing to have biosafety procedures that could contain the bacteria, “causing infection of” the Brahman cow. The letter, signed by the chief of enforcement operations, told LSU it could settle the matter by paying a $425,000 penalty.
The fine came as a surprise to the university, said Phil Elzer, the scientist running the Brucella research when the incident happened and who now is an associate vice chancellor at the LSU AgCenter. “We went back to them and basically said: We had no release, no one proved a release, no one proved it was our strain. We challenged them,” Elzer said in an interview with USA TODAY. Elzer said LSU had for years routinely sent to slaughter the program’s research cattle, which were tagged as being “suspect” or having brucellosis. This practice was declared in the research program’s operating procedures that were reviewed and signed off on at each inspection by Federal Select Agent Program regulators, he said. “To all of a sudden say we were doing it wrong was very surprising,” Elzer said.
In August 2008, LSU’s Durham sent a letter to USDA asking for a hearing and offering to meet to discuss “the apparent misinformation/erroneous conclusions upon which the alleged violations and proposed penalty are based.” In an interview with USA TODAY, Durham said: “From our standpoint, we tried to do everything right.”
In initial written statements to USA TODAY and in interviews, Elzer and Durham indicated that federal and state investigators never concluded the university’s experiments were at fault. “The incident was not found to be caused by a violation of federal regulations; no fines were imposed upon LSU, and the regulatory agencies had uncertainty as to whether the strain of bacteria in the affected cow was the same strain that was being used in the LSU research,” they said in a November 2014 email to USA TODAY before granting an interview a few days later.
Yet, in early December 2014, when USA TODAY received copies of the USDA and Louisiana agriculture departments’ investigative reports in response to public records requests, the documents showed no uncertainty. An LSU spokeswoman sent an email clarifying that the “uncertainty” expressed by Elzer involved a USDA test result showing the bacteria in the infected animal didn’t produce a substance called H2S, “while the lab organism being used in Dr. Elzer’s research did produce H2S.” This distinction is not flagged or discussed in the released federal or state records as raising any concerns about a bacteria mismatch.
It’s unclear, based on records obtained by USA TODAY, what happened in the months that followed LSU’s request for a hearing. But in January 2010, the USDA sent a letter to LSU saying the case was being closed. Though the letter reiterated information about the potential release of Brucella abortus and the transfer of infected cattle to an unregistered slaughter plant, there is no mention of any fine or that a fine had been dropped. The letter reminded the university of its obligation to have sufficient biosafety and containment procedures and that transfers of select agents must be authorized by a federal official. Elzer said the fine was eventually withdrawn by the USDA. Why the fine was dropped is unknown. The USDA’s enforcement tracking system includes only this note: “$425,000 HAS BEEN RESCINDED PER THE PROGRAM.”
In its annual report to Congress about thefts, losses or releases of select agents during 2008, the Federal Select Agent Program – which is jointly run by the CDC and USDA – provided aggregated counts of incidents by type but did not name any labs that had issues. The report noted there were two “validated reports of a release of a select agent” and that one release was identified during routine brucellosis testing when a “cow in an adjacent brucellosis-free herd at a facility with ongoing brucellosis research tested positive for brucellosis and was destroyed. The report was referred to IES for apparent non-compliance with the Select Agent Regulations and resulted in USDA and HHS suspending the entity’s research. In addition, IES imposed a civil money penalty of $425,000.” The report to Congress was dated June 2009 – 10 months after LSU had asked for a hearing to appeal the fine.
USDA officials declined requests for interviews about the LSU incident, why Congress was told the fine had been imposed when it wasn’t and why none of the later reports to Congress sought to correct the enforcement record. In a written statement, Freeda Isaac, the USDA’s director of Agriculture Select Agent Services, said the 2008 report “should have stated that we were proposing a fine, instead of stating we issued a fine. In the end, there was no fine.” Isaac added in November 2014: “In response to the Brucella release listed in the report, [USDA] did suspend a portion of the registration at LSU related to that release and required the entity to address the issues related to that release. That portion of the registration is still suspended.”
The LSU AgCenter no longer conducts experiments with select agent strains of Brucella, Elzer said – not even in the new facility that a press release from 2012 says had been built with his vaccine work in mind. As the facility was nearing completion, Elzer said that federal requirements for labs working with Brucella changed and would have required “a couple million dollars” worth of modifications to the building, “so we decided not to do select agent work there.”
None of the details about this serious lab safety incident or how federal lab regulators failed to impose the fine would be public if not for months of investigation by USA TODAY. Although LSU officials eventually granted interviews in November 2014 and released a copy of their internal investigation report and some related regulatory records in December 2014, the university initially denied USA TODAY’s August 2014 open records request. LSU also denied repeated appeals by a reporter and an attorney for the newspaper saying the records must be released. An attorney for LSU, Thomas Peak, had argued that federal bioterrorism regulations prohibited release of records about the incident and later said that the university’s records of the incident didn’t meet the definition of public records because they were generated because of the Federal Select Agent Program. LSU spokesman Ernie Ballard said university staff couldn’t discuss the case in an interview “without CDC permission.” Yet officials at the CDC and USDA told USA TODAY there were no prohibitions against select-agent labs discussing their research or disciplinary cases. After USA TODAY told university officials that the newspaper had obtained records in December from the USDA and Louisiana’s agriculture department detailing their investigations’ findings, LSU released its records.

        <div class="hr1"></div>
        <p class="byline"> by Alison Young and John Hillkirk</p> 
        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The Tulane National Primate Research Center has two BSL-3 labs in Covington, La., approximately 40 miles from the university’s main campus in New Orleans, and the university plans to add a third at its downtown health science center. None of the BSL-3 labs is on the main campus. Michael Strecker, the university’s executive director of public relations, said the focus of the BSL-3 work is developing vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics for a variety of infectious agents, including tuberculosis, Burkholderia, ricin toxin and chikungunya virus.
The primate center became the focus of federal and state investigations in December 2014 after tests showed two rhesus macaque monkeys – which were not part of any experiments – were sickened by a strain of bioterror bacteria being studied in a BSL-3 lab elsewhere on the 500-acre campus. Later tests showed additional monkeys had been exposed.
The lab incident is of particular concern because some monkeys exposed to the bacteria were kept in a huge, outdoor breeding colony on the facility’s South Campus. 
The bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, lives and grows in soil and water and is primarily found in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is not found in the United States. Louisiana state officials have expressed concern that the lab accident may have resulted in the environment around the primate center becoming contaminated with the bacteria. Tulane officials have said they do not believe the bacteria had gotten out of their buildings.
The bacteria can cause a potentially serious disease called melioidosis in people and animals. It has a wide range of symptoms, from fever to localized skin infections to deadly pneumonias. Contact with contaminated soil or water is the main route of exposure. Most of those exposed will not show any symptoms. But the bacteria can hide for years in the body, CDC officials said. In countries where the bacterium is endemic, the fatality rate for patients with melioidosis can be up to 50%. And even with the best medical care, infections can be difficult to treat and involve long courses of antibiotics, CDC officials said.
The bacterium has been studied in other countries as a possible bioweapon; Tulane said its research involved work to develop a potential vaccine. (Full coverage of the incident is available at: biolabs.usatoday.com.) As a result of the release of the bacteria, federal regulators ordered Tulane’s primate center to halt all research involving select agents until the cause of the accident was identified and corrections were made. Andrew Lackner, primate center director, said about 10 projects involving a variety of select agents were affected by the order. Sloppy biosafety practices and contaminated worker clothing are the likely ways the bacteria got out of Tulane’s lab, according to findings by federal investigators released in March 2015.
The CDC last inspected Tulane’s select-agent labs in December 2013. No significant problems were cited. The primate center had never been suspended or subjected to regulatory enforcement actions before, the agency said.
According to Tulane’s biosafety committee minutes, the committee approved a research project involving Burkholderia at its July 25, 2014, meeting. Although the specific type of the bacteria was redacted by the university, in the minutes a researcher heading the project lists Burkholderia pseudomallei as one of her research interests on Tulane’s website. It is unclear whether this is the same research that was involved in the bacteria release incident.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The university’s Shreveport campus is home to an ABSL-3 suite with two laboratories and two animal care rooms, said Matthew Woolard, an assistant microbiology and immunology professor. Researchers at the university’s Health Sciences Center are working on a vaccine for tularemia, a bacterial disease that can be spread through animals and is deadly to humans without treatment. Infected patients can show symptoms from skin lesions to coughing and chest pain similar to pneumonia, according to the CDC. The bacteria is classified as a Tier 1 select agent because of its ability to be used as a bioterror agent, Woolard said.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The University of Massachusetts Medical School operates both BSL-3 and ABSL-3 facilities on its 74-acre campus in Worcester, about 50 miles west of Boston. Mark Shelton, a university spokesman, declined to answer specifics about the number of labs or the location of the laboratories, citing security concerns. Shelton confirmed that the school is registered to work with select agents but declined to name them. “Our reading of the regulations from the CDC bars us from providing that information,” he said. “We’re erring on the side of caution since our consciousness has been raised about the broadening safety and security concerns in the past 15 years.” UMass Medical School’s research is undertaken to improve human health, develop treatments for disease and alleviate human suffering, Shelton said. Scientists develop vaccines, research ways to improve treatments and therapies, and work to unlock the basic mechanisms of disease.
The University of Massachusetts initially tried to charge $541.50 to release copies of its Institutional Biosafety Committee records, which are required to be made public under the NIH Guidelines as a condition of federal research funding. Despite objections filed with the medical school that the fees were excessive, Associate Vice Chancellor James Healy said that they were not a deterrent to access and that the university deliberately used the lowest-paid employee to review and redact the records. The school provided a list of six individuals who needed to review the records. One of those included the top Institutional Biosafety Committee member that would have been paid $60 per hour. After USA TODAY filed a complaint with the National Institutes of Health about excessive fees, the medical school provided the records at no charge.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Boston University operates eight BSL-3 suites, all located on its medical campus, wrote Colin Riley, a university spokesman. The labs are registered to work with select agents and with Francisella tularensis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Yersenia pestis. The National Institutes of Health has issued guidance to labs recommending that institutions post Institutional Biosafety Committee minutes online. BU is among only a few labs that USA TODAY found doing this.
BU is home to the National Emerging Infectious Disease Laboratories (NEIDL), which, in addition to BSL-3 labs, houses a BSL-4 laboratory that is in the process of being permitted by the city and federal government. The seven-story building adjacent to the BU Medical Campus will support the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ biodefense research agenda. Construction of the $200 million NEIDL facility was completed in September 2008, but controversy and litigation have kept much of the building’s 192,000 square feet of laboratory space closed, according to a university website. University officials say the lab will develop diagnostics, vaccines and treatments to combat emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.

Caldwell declined to release more information about the pathogens used in the lab but said it is not registered to work with select agents and toxins. Lab oversight documents say BSL-3 space is used for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In February 2014, a researcher was working with E. coli and cut his hand on a glass flask when it broke. The deep cut needed emergency room care, and the researcher was given antibiotics. An investigation into the incident found that the lab did not have approval to work with the specific E. coli strain. The incident triggered retraining and a formal lab inspection.</p>

The tuberculosis work is aimed at obtaining a better understanding of drug resistance in the disease and developing improved treatment for the 9 million people who become sick with TB globally each year, said Rebecca Caruso, director of Harvard Medical School’s Office of Biological Safety. The HIV research focuses on investigating disease pathogenesis, drug efficacy and transmission efficiency. For example, some projects work to improve chemoprophylaxis to block mother-to-infant transmission of HIV and also to address increased disease and mortality in uninfected infants born to HIV-infected mothers. Harvard laboratories also study the development of drug resistance and the possible transmission of drug-resistant variants.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The Maryland State Public Health Laboratory operates BSL-3 labs to perform diagnostic and public health surveillance testing for such pathogens as West Nile virus, Francisella tularensis, Eastern equine encephalitis virus and for travel-associated infections such as Brucella, dengue and chikungunya, health department officials said. The high-containment labs also are used to detect agents in clinical or environmental samples that may be associated with bioterrorism. The labs are not used for biomedical research. 
The 234,000-square-foot Maryland Public Health Laboratory in Baltimore, which had a ribbon-cutting ceremony in July 2014, is scheduled to have all construction completed for staff to move in by spring 2015, said spokeswoman Karen Black. It will replace a 40-year-old facility, which also has BSL-3 facilities.
Maryland requires annual state registration of labs working with pathogens designated as select agents because of their potential use as bioterrorism agents or the significant threat they pose to public health or agriculture. These labs also must report incidents to the state. The purpose of the Biological Agent Registration Program is to help protect Maryland residents against the threat of biological terrorism by using the registration information for planning and response, department officials said in written responses to USA TODAY’s questions. The law requires those working with select agents to, among other things, tell state regulators which pathogens they have, their location and their biosafety level of containment and to provide a biological incident response plan. State officials note that the regulations, however, can’t compel federal laboratories operating in Maryland to register with the program.
Maryland’s regulation prohibits the registration program from releasing information about reported incidents. The department can’t even release how many labs are registered, Black said.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The Army bills its Edgewood Chemical Biological Center as “the nation’s principal research and development resource” for non-medical chemical and biological defense – working on such things as equipment evaluation and technology development, according to the center’s website.
Edgewood has one operational BSL-3 lab and is registered to work with select agents, the Army said in a statement. 
The center had one laboratory incident during 2013 and 2014, the Army said in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by USA TODAY. The incident on Dec. 29, 2014, involved the potential exposures of two laboratory workers to specimens of a weakened strain of Yersinia pestis, a bacterium that causes plague, which was being dried for a suspicious-powders study.
One exposure occurred when a lab manager, with a bare hand that had cuts on it, ran a finger across a machine’s lid while examining a slimy substance that was thought to be innocuous. The machine “was only meant to be used with non-hazardous materials,” the report said. A lab tech also was possibly exposed, the report said, while opening and decontaminating the machine. Both employees were offered antibiotics, but one declined to take them, the report says.
The strain involved in the incident, the report says, is not considered a select agent and had been weakened in a way that allows its general use in a BSL-2 laboratory rather than in BSL-3 containment, which is needed for work with virulent strains. Still, the incident caused concern among lab officials because a different weakened strain of the bacterium had killed a scientist with an underlying medical condition at the University of Chicago in 2009.
Army officials did not answer questions about the types of pathogens in use in Edgewood’s labs, saying: &#34;ECBC is registered with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for work with select agents. The types of select agents we work with is dependent upon the research needs and the tasks being undertaken.”
When asked for examples, the Army referred USA TODAY to documents the United States files with the United Nations as part of its transparency obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention.
According to the U.S. report filed in April 2014, the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center’s scientists published papers during 2013 involving research on the inactivation of vaccinia virus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
During 2012, another U.S. report to the United Nations cites published research from Edgewood including a report on improved environmental tracking of an anthrax simulant and an examination of the genomics of seasonal plague caused by Yersinia pestis. The purpose of research at the facility, the report says, is “development of non-medical defensive material against biological agents to include: research, development, and engineering for methods of rapid detection, identification, decontamination, and physical protection from biological threat agents.”
During the 2001 anthrax attacks, the center’s BSL-3 lab was involved in investigations to determine how anthrax spores were spread among letters sent through the mail, according to information on the center’s website. Other work has involved comparing the effectiveness of decontamination technologies – such as vapor hydrogen peroxide, chlorine dioxide and hot humid air – for use in buildings or aircraft interiors.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The University of Maryland-Baltimore has three BSL-3 labs and one ABSL-3 lab, all on the main campus. Much of the work involves the development of vaccines. The scientists look at how pathogens get into the human body and how they work within the body, said Alex Likowsky, the director of media relations at UMB. For example, scientists are investigating how viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) replicate and cause disease. The goal is to develop drugs, antibodies and vaccines to treat or prevent diseases caused by such viruses, and even potentially for other coronaviruses that may emerge in the future, Likowsky said. The ABSL-3 lab is run by Veterinary Resources, but it’s also used by the School of Medicine’s Microbiology and Immunology unit and the researchers at the Center for Vaccine Development. One of the BSL-3 labs is in the School of Dentistry’s Microbial Pathogenesis department. The other two BSL-3 labs are in the School of Medicine’s Microbiology and Immunology department, but one is also used by the Center for Vaccine Development, Likowsky said.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The National Institutes of Health (NIH) operates 17 BSL-3 lab suites on its campus in Bethesda, the agency said. Pathogens used in the research include monkey pox, West Nile virus, dengue virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and strains of influenza that include some classified as select agents.
The purpose of the research is “to better understand the cause and spread of pathogens, drug screening studies and vaccine development to protect against infection,” the agency said in a statement.
In the summer of 2014, forgotten specimens of several pathogens, including the deadly smallpox virus, were discovered in a storage room of a lab used by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on the NIH campus. 
The NIH’s biosafety committee minutes cover a wide range of labs in Bethesda as well as those at the agency’s NIAID Integrated Research Facility in Frederick, Md., and most reports include a count of recent lab incidents by general category of incident.
For example, the November 2014 minutes say: “In the month of September there were 17 total injuries, none of which involved rDNA. The injuries were as follows: 5 sharps related, 5 nonhuman primate (NHP) related, 6 other animal related, 1 human blood and body fluid, and 1 unknown. The patient involved in the ‘unknown’ injury had an allergic reaction to a rat bite, and it is unclear whether this reaction was directly related to the rat or to the fact that the rat had tested positive for a parvovirus; notably, it is unusual for humans to have symptoms due to a rodent-borne parvovirus.”
The minutes for January 2013 through November 2014 note more than 300 incidents at the Bethesda and Frederick facilities. Most involve research animals, such as scratches or bites. Most of the rest involve needle sticks or other sharps incidents, the records show.
Safety committee minutes from September 2014 include discussion of BSL-3 research involving chikungunya virus with an ultimate goal of developing a live-attenuated vaccine candidate. “Various strains of CHIKV will be amplified in tissue culture cells to create working stocks of virus and the stocks evaluated for their tissue culture phenotypes, mosquito infectivity and dissemination, and genomic sequence,” the minutes say.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The Department of Homeland Security’s National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center has 27,590 square feet of BSL-3 lab space and 10,540 square feet of BSL-4 lab space, spokesman John Verrico said.
The center, which focuses on forensic analysis and bioterrorism threat characterization, is part of a biological research consortium involving multiple high-containment labs at Fort Detrick. The lab is registered to work with select agents, Verrico said.
Although the DHS lab posts minutes of its institutional biosafety committee on the Web, the documents contain little information about pathogens being used or the purpose of the research.
A typical entry looks like this one from the lab’s September 2014 safety committee minutes: “The committee reviewed a newly submitted amendment for IBC registration IBC‐14‐0019 in which the PI was changed. No issues were noted or requests for revisions made. A motion was made by J.G. to approve the amendment pending verification of training. This motion was seconded by M.J.R. and unanimously approved with one abstention.”
New research projects aren’t described in the minutes. “The committee reviewed newly submitted registration IBC‐14‐0019. The PI was in attendance to provide a brief summary of the project and answer any questions. The committee discussed the risks and procedures of the project. A motion was made by J.R.S. to approve the registration, was seconded by B.C and unanimously approved,” according to an entry in the lab’s January 2014 minutes.
In response to a Freedom of Information Act request from USA TODAY for copies of lab incident reports from 2013 to the present, the department in April 2014 provided two interim releases of records consisting mostly of a series of monthly composite reports titled “Mishaps, Lessons Learned &amp; Success Stories” for January 2013 through February 2015. The reports include multiple incidents of holes developing in spacesuit-like full-body protective gear used when working with deadly pathogens in BSL-4 labs, a potentially missing vial of a bioterror pathogen and an exploding freezer bag of specimens. 
On July 25, 2014, while wearing a suit and taking a chemical shower before leaving a BSL-4 lab, the scrubs the employee was wearing under the protective suit became wet on the back of one leg “where a previous patch had been installed,” the report says. Lab officials determined that no potential exposure occurred. The report doesn’t say what pathogen had been worked with in the lab. “The suit was retired,” the report says. On Sept. 24 and 29, 2014, workers’ suits developed holes that they discovered when the suits leaked while showering out of BSL-4 labs. One suit developed a hole in the shoulder area and the other suit had a zipper that was worn and leaking. In both cases the report sites “Design issues” as the root cause. On Oct. 2, 2014, a worker noticed their suit leaking through the top of their visor while in the shower. Two more suits were reported with holes on Oct. 30, 2014. Three more suits with holes were reported in January 2015.
In July 2014, research staff discovered a missing vial of an undisclosed select agent, the government’s term for pathogens with potential to be used as bioweapons. Lab staff said they think the content of the vial may have been added to others from the same shipment, the report says. Also in July 2014, a worker reported that while opening a minus-80-degree-Celsius freezer in the BSL-4 lab, “a plastic ziplock bag that was expanded to capacity spontaneously burst discharging the contents towards the head of my BSL-4 suit. 4 2ml cryovial tubes were discharged from the rupture in the ziplock bag towards my person and onto the floor.”
Meanwhile, an  October 2014 report said an “employee noticed a stink bug while in the BSL-3 shower of the second floor. The stink bug never left containment. Health and Safety discarded the stink bug within containment. The area was also surface decontaminated. The employee was right to recognize the pest and its implications for biological safety.”</p>

        <p class="byline"> by Alison Young and Catherine Sheffo</p> 
        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, commonly referred to as USAMRIID, says it performs medical biological defense research to protect members of the military from biological threats. It also investigates disease outbreaks and other threats to public health. The organization has been a key Defense Department laboratory since 1969. USAMRIID says its research has included work with Ebola and Marburg viruses, as well as anthrax, plague, hantavirus, botulism, ricin toxin and staphylococcal enterotoxin B. USAMRIID’s facilities include labs that operate at BSL-3, as well as some that operate at BSL-4, the highest containment level used for the world’s most deadly pathogens. Viruses such as Ebola are worked with in BSL-4 labs. Staff working in the BSL-4 labs at USAMRIID wear “fully encapsulating positive-pressure suits” – which are often referred to as spacesuits – and breathe HEPA-filtered air. Before leaving a BSL-4 lab, a worker must take a liquid disinfectant shower and a personal shower, the lab said in a statement.
In response to a Freedom of Information Act request from USA TODAY, USAMRIID released nearly 300 pages of reports of incidents that occurred in its labs during 2012, 2013 and 2014. The Army has blacked out significant portions of the records. The records show at least 37 incidents of holes or tears developing in personal protective equipment over a 20-month period in 2013 and 2014. Some reports indicate defective protective suits, others indicate the suits were old or worn out. A lab worker who was performing an autopsy on an animal reported a small split in a seam of a suit in March 2013. The nature of the exposure was redacted from the report. The cause: “Apparent repetitive use defect in 9-year old suit that split due to repeated bending/folding resulting in material failure.”
In December 2013, while exiting the chemical shower, a researcher discovered that a previously repaired hole in their suit’s left foot had broken open again. In January 2014, a seam separated on the heel of a contractor’s blue BSL-4 suit. In February 2014, another worker found a hole in the foot of their blue safety suit while showering out and the report notes: “Small holes in the feet of the Blue suits is a relatively common event. This is a known weakness/flaw in these suits.” On a single day in May 2014, a scientist noticed that their leg got wet while showering out of the lab and the report cites defective equipment; and another worker reported finding a hole in their visor while showering out. In July 2014, three incidents involved holes or tears; two specified they were in the feet of their suits.
The reports note incidents involving problems with biosafety cabinets, which are special, enclosed spaces that help contain pathogens when scientists work with them.
According to a June 26, 2013, incident report, a laboratory technician reported that “power outage caused biosafety cabinet to fail.” The agents were in culture plates with lids, the report says. “BSC was not on backup power; continuing safety issue for institute. … Anticipate [redacted] will provide backup power to all BSCs.” On June 14, 2013, a microbiologist reported that a biosafety cabinet “failed while individual was counting [redacted] colonies on plates (closed with lid).” The nature of the exposure was redacted but the report says, “The cause was defective equipment.” Officials with USAMRIID declined to be interviewed. In a written statement, the lab officials said that the spacesuit-like protective gear worn by scientists in BSL-4 labs “are replaced continuously” based on testing by those in the BSL-4 suite or the organization’s safety division. All incidents with gloves and suits are tracked and investigated “regardless of the level of risk” to make sure no trend is developing and the information is provided to manufacturers, the lab said.
All positive-pressure encapsulating suits used inside the USAMRIID BSL-4 suites are thoroughly tested and inspected before they are initially issued, and by laboratory personnel prior to each entry, the lab said.
USAMRIID also said that even with a tear, the air pressure in the suit would keep pathogens from entering: “The suits are supplied by a dedicated air system that is HEPA filtered prior to reaching the suit. The supplied air protects the individuals wearing the positive pressure encapsulating suits by functioning both as their source of breathing air and as a secondary protective envelope in case of a suit or outer glove tear. The suits are positively pressurized, and the laboratory suites are operating under continuous negative airflow, so any hole or tear in a suit results in the air blowing away from the individual wearing it.
The life span of the suits varies depending on who wears it, the type of work they do and how often they go into the BSL-4 suites, USAMRIID said, adding: “That is why some suits have lasted significantly longer than others before needing to be removed from active service.” If a biosafety cabinet loses power, USAMRIID said, staff are trained to “slowly remove their hands from the unit so as not to disturb the ‘curtain of airflow,’ ” then to close the unit and report the incident. Although USAMRIID said it has emergency power for critical systems, not all biosafety cabinets have emergency backup power. USAMRIID, in its statement, emphasized that it “has decades of experience operating containment laboratories. Our primary objective is to provide a safe and secure environment for our workforce and the surrounding communities.”
In 2009, a military scientist at USAMRIID was diagnosed with tularemia, a disease caused by a bacteria considered to pose a potential bioterror threat. The scientist was treated with antibiotics, according to information USAMRIID released at the time.
In 2004, a USAMRIID scientist working in a BSL-4 lab was potentially exposed to a strain of Ebola virus while trying to inject a mouse infected two days earlier, according to an account published by USAMRIID scientists in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. The mouse “kicked the syringe, causing the needle to pierce the person’s left hand gloves, resulting in a small laceration,” the report says. The scientist was quarantined in a special isolation treatment facility at USAMRIID referred to as “the slammer.” The patient never became ill and was discharged after 21 days.
In spring 2000, a microbiologist from USAMRIID became the first human case of a disease called glanders in the United States since 1945, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the infection. The microbiologist worked with several types of bacteria, including Burkholderia mallei, the pathogen that causes glanders. The scientist’s symptoms worsened over about six weeks and he eventually became so ill he was put on a mechanical ventilator. Tests eventually identified Burkholderia mallei in fluid from a liver abscess, and after the patient was given antibiotics that the strain was sensitive to, his symptoms rapidly improved. The CDC noted that “the patient did not recall an unusual incident while working with B. mallei. … Most laboratory-acquired infections are associated with routine handling of microbes and not with injuries.”
According to the FBI, the source of the 2001 anthrax letter attacks in the United States that killed five and sickened 17 was USAMRIID biologist Bruce Ivins. In 2008, as charges were about to be filed, Ivins took a fatal overdose of Tylenol. The FBI’s investigation, however, has been questioned over the years, including reports by the National Academy of Sciences and the Government Accountability Office that questioned the scientific testing used to link the mailed anthrax spores to Ivins’ lab.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The National Institutes of Health’s NIAID Integrated Research Facility in Frederick, Md., is located at Fort Detrick. It has one large biocontainment lab that covers 11,000 net square feet, the NIH said. It can be configured as a BSL-3, a BSL-4 or a combination of the two. It has four suites plus animal support and advanced imaging areas, the agency said in response to questions from USA TODAY.
The facility is registered to work with all Category A viral pathogens, except smallpox, that require BSL-4 containment. “However, at present, almost all our work is centered on Ebola in response to the outbreak in West Africa,” the agency said in a statement in March 2015.
Work includes refining animal models to test the effectiveness of drugs and vaccines against the deadly virus. “We are also performing high throughput screening of candidate antiviral drugs for Ebola in cell culture and advancing promising candidates to animal testing,” NIH said. Another project involves work on detection systems, including some that can be used in resource-poor locations. 
“We have similar programs for Nipah, Lassa, and MERS but these have received less emphasis since the surge for Ebola,” the NIH said in its statement.
The NIH’s biosafety committee minutes cover a range of labs at the Frederick facility as well as labs on its main campus in Bethesda, Md., and most reports include a count of recent lab incidents by general category of incident. 
For example, the November 2014 minutes say: “In the month of September there were 17 total injuries, none of which involved rDNA. The injuries were as follows: 5 sharps related, 5 nonhuman primate (NHP) related, 6 other animal related, 1 human blood and body fluid, and 1 unknown. The patient involved in the ‘unknown’ injury had an allergic reaction to a rat bite, and it is unclear whether this reaction was directly related to the rat or to the fact that the rat had tested positive for a parvovirus; notably, it is unusual for humans to have symptoms due to a rodent-borne parvovirus.”
The minutes for January 2013 through November 2014 note more than 300 incidents at the Bethesda and Frederick facilities. Most involve research animals, such as scratches or bites. Most of the rest involve needle sticks or other sharps incidents, the records show.
The safety committee’s September 2014 minutes include discussion of separate ABSL-4 studies exploring rabies virus-based vaccines against both the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
During 2013, minutes from the July meeting show approval of an amendment to allow “Aerosol MERS CoV Inoculation of Nonhuman Primates.” The work was to be done using “ABSL-4 practices” at the IRF-Frederick, with animal work approved at ABSL-3 “with the understanding that the work occurs in an all–ABSL-4 facility.”

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Southern Research Institute, with facilities in Maryland, Alabama and North Carolina, provides research services to industry and the federal government, according to its website. Its lab facilities in Frederick, Md., and Birmingham, Ala., each have BSL-3 facilities capable of working with a range of pathogens, including select agents. According to minutes of the institute’s biosafety committee, released in response to a request from USA TODAY, experiments in recent years have involved SARS and MERS viruses, influenza strains and development of a vaccine against Lassa fever, but it is unclear which pathogens are researched at which facility. “As for specific projects in which we’re currently involved, this information is proprietary, and confidentiality agreements with both our government and commercial clients prohibit us from disseminating project details,” institute spokesperson Rossi Morris said in an email. The institute, Morris said generally, has established systems to support preclinical vaccine studies for influenza, HIV/AIDS, SARS, smallpox and other pathogens. Morris said there were no NIH-reportable lab incidents at the Maryland and Alabama facilities from Jan. 1, 2012, through Dec. 12, 2014, when the institute responded to USA TODAY’s records request. The non-profit, tax-exempt organization was founded in 1941. It had more than $81.6 million in revenue in 2012, according to the group’s federal non-profit tax return.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Sequella describes itself on its website as a private, clinical-stage pharmaceutical company that works on products for antibiotic-resistant bacterial diseases. The company’s website says its headquarters in Rockville houses various laboratories, including “Biosafety Level-3 (BSL-3) laboratories for the manipulation of high-hazard pathogenic microorganisms.” The pathogens it works with include tuberculosis, the website says.
Sequella is not registered to work with select agents, said Andrew Phipps, the company’s chief science officer. While the lab receives some federal funding, its work does not involve recombinant DNA experiments that require compliance with the transparency requirements of the NIH Guidelines.
“Since these NIH Guidelines [do] not apply to Sequella, we are not required to hold Institutional Biosafety Committee meetings or provide any other documents concerning our BSL-3 to the National Institutes of Health,” Phipps said in an emailed statement. “However, our laboratory operations are fully compliant with all applicable Federal and State regulations. We have not had an exposure or potential exposure or reportable incident or accident related to our BSL-3 since the facility opened in 1999.”
As a private company, Sequella is not directly subject to state or federal open records laws.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently opened its new Life Sciences-Biodefense Laboratory Complex on the agency’s campus north of Washington, D.C. The facility will be used for development and licensing of drugs, vaccines and other therapeutics.
“This new lab will better support the FDA’s Medical Counter-Measure initiative, including pandemic influenza preparedness, as well as facilitating development of products to prevent global diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, and of course Ebola,” according to the text of a speech FDA’s then-commissioner, Margaret Hamburg, gave at the building’s dedication in September 2014.  
The FDA said it has 10 BSL-3 labs in Silver Spring. Yet when USA TODAY first asked the FDA about the kinds of pathogens that would be worked with in the new labs, the agency declined to give examples. 
“In the interest of security, we cannot address specific pathogens that will be contained in the BSL-3 labs,” the agency said in an April 9, 2015, statement. “In the interest of security, we cannot address whether or not we will have a select agent registered lab.”
According to the FDA’s budget justification documents, which the agency posts on its website, the new facility will, among other things, be used to address emerging threats including West Nile virus, SARS, dengue and Chagas’ disease, and it will allow the FDA “to improve the development of assays, standards and tests for products to prevent and treat these illnesses.” The facility also will increase the agency’s ability to evaluate influenza vaccines, the documents say.
The budget justification documents note that “most of the work on new medical countermeasures requires access to Bio-safety Level-3 (BSL-3) containment” and that the facility will expand capacity to work on pandemic influenza preparedness and a medical countermeasures initiative.
 “The BSL-3 labs include special containment equipment, autoclaves with bio-seal double doors, special showers, and a clean room system,” the budget document says. 
The FDA declined to provide a photo of the new building’s exterior, saying “it is a risk to the security of the operations to provide photographs of the BSL-3 laboratories.” Yet USA TODAY found images and details of the building being promoted on the Web by one of the construction firms involved in the project. 
After being told that other agencies within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services saw no security issues with providing the types of basic information that USA TODAY requested about their labs, the FDA acknowledged its new BSL-3 labs will be registered to work with select agents and that research may include work with infectious agents such as new pandemic influenza strains, dengue virus, tuberculosis and SARS.
And after initially not providing the names of cities where it operates additional labs, the FDA said it also has BSL-3 labs in Jamaica, N.Y.; Irvine, Calif.; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Laurel, Md. These labs are used to provide testing services in the event of a national emergency, such as a food-borne illness outbreak, the agency said.

In 2013, MRIGlobal was awarded a contract worth up to $11.96 million to develop tests for the diagnosis of anthrax, plague and tularemia in people suspected of being infected, federal records show. The organization is registered to work with select agents, according to its brochures. In Rockville, the firm has a 46,000-square-foot facility that focuses on biosurveillance and monitoring programs and includes BSL-3 labs, according to one of its brochures. William Bailey, the firm’s manager for quality and regulatory systems, declined to answer USA TODAY’s questions about the firm’s research at individual facilities and what pathogens it involves. He referred a reporter to the organization’s website. Bailey said MRIGlobal is not required to make public the minutes of its Institutional Biosafety Committee’s meetings because the recombinant DNA work the organization has done in recent years is exempt from NIH Guidelines that would require disclosure. MRIGlobal is a private, not-for-profit organization founded in 1944 as Midwest Research Institute, its website says. It has operations in nine states and the District of Columbia, according to its website. It has BSL-3 lab facilities in Kansas City, Mo., Palm Bay, Fla., and Rockville, Md. The organization had nearly $100 million in revenue during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, according to its federal non-profit tax return.</p>

These labs are used for everything from tuberculosis, West Nile virus and select agent screening, to advanced bacteriology and virology testing. All three labs are used daily with one specific BSL-3 lab registered with the Federal Select Agent Program. 
HETL is the only authorized entity to work with select agents in Maine. If an accident were to occur in a select-agent lab, the Centers for Disease and Prevention in Atlanta would be notified as well as the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Martins said.

Thome said that various biological agents are studied on campus and that viral vector techniques are being explored for vaccine development, cancer research, clinical test development and to treat neurological disorders. The specific agents used depend on factors like tissue specificity, efficiency of delivery and program funding. Due to those variations, Thome declined to provide specific examples of pathogens but called them “quite diverse.” Mayo Clinic is not registered to work with select agents. </p>

In 2013, MRIGlobal was awarded a contract worth up to $11.96 million to develop tests for the diagnosis of anthrax, plague and tularemia in people suspected of being infected, federal records show. The organization is registered to work with select agents, according to its brochures. At its Kansas City, Mo., headquarters facility, MRIGlobal has 260,000 square feet of biological and chemical laboratories, including at BSL-3, plus two field stations for agricultural studies, according to a company brochure. William Bailey, the firm’s manager for quality and regulatory systems, declined to answer USA TODAY’s questions about the firm’s research at individual facilities and what pathogens it involves. He referred a reporter to the organization’s website. Bailey said MRIGlobal is not required to make public the minutes of its Institutional Biosafety Committee’s meetings because the recombinant DNA work the organization has done in recent years is exempt from NIH Guidelines that require disclosure. MRIGlobal is a private, not-for-profit organization founded in 1944 as Midwest Research Institute, its website says. It has operations in nine states and the District of Columbia, according to its website. It has BSL-3 lab facilities in Kansas City, Mo., Palm Bay, Fla., and Rockville, Md. The organization had nearly $100 million in revenue during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, according to its federal non-profit tax return.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The Mississippi Public Health Laboratory (MPHL) operates two BSL-3 laboratories in Jackson. These BSL-3 laboratories are a part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Laboratory Response Network and are used on a routine basis, according to Daphne Ware, director of the MPHL. These labs perform everything from routine diagnostic testing to the identification of potential chemical or bioterrorism agents.
 Ware said the MPHL is not aware of any group in the health department or any other state agency that tracks facilities that operate BSL-3 or BSL-4 labs in the state. Mississippi’s state labs are not required to notify the MPHL regarding lab-associated incidents, and the MPHL is not copied on any select-agent incident reports.
However, the Mississippi State Department of Health requests that all laboratories report the appearance of any unusual diseases or illnesses, including previously controlled or eradicated infectious agents, or biological or chemical toxins, Ware said.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Rocky Mountain Laboratories, which is operated by a division of the National Institutes of Health, has five BSL-3 lab suites and related animal support areas. It also has four BSL-4 lab suites, plus related animal support areas, the lab said in response to USA TODAY’s questions.
BSL-4, where scientists wear full-body, spacesuit-like protective gear, is the highest level of laboratory containment and is used to work with the most dangerous pathogens for which there are no vaccines or treatments. As of April 2015, almost all of the BSL-4 lab space was focused on research with the deadly Ebola virus because of the outbreak in West Africa, the lab said in an emailed statement. “Additional projects under way in the level-3 and level-4 laboratories involve MERS, Lassa, Nipah, Hendra, hanta, dengue, West Nile, tick-borne encephalitis and other viruses; and the agents that cause tularemia, plague, Q fever and other bacterial diseases,” the lab said. In most cases, the research uses animal models of disease to develop diagnostic tests, treatments and vaccines.
In May 2014, scientists inside one of Rocky Mountain Laboratories’ BSL-4 labs spent hours – while wearing their bulky spacesuit-like protective gear – searching for a mouse that had escaped inside the lab, according to an incident report. The mouse had been infected 21 days earlier with a strain of Lassa virus, which causes a type of hemorrhagic fever with symptoms similar to Ebola. The mouse was found and captured the next morning, the records say, and “was disposed of.” USA TODAY reported on this incident in September 2014. In August 2014, other records show, an employee in a BSL-3 lab had a HEPA filter fall out of their air-purifying respirator while doing work with Oropouche virus inside a biosafety cabinet. Oropouche virus causes Oropouche fever, a disease found in South America. “While the PAPR [powered air-purifying respirator] was compromised, no agent was present in the laboratory outside of primary containment at the time of the incident. The results of smoke testing indicated that a loose HEPA housing would compromise the ability of the PAPR to protect the user from aerosols. In addition, smoke testing indicated that, even under the worst conditions (2 people using vigorous arm movements and crossing arms extensively), smoke (aerosol simulant) was not released from the cabinet. Therefore, even if the HEPA filter had been loose for an unknown period of time, the BSC [biosafety cabinet] and lab air handling system were functioning properly. Taken together, the results indicate that the compromised PAPR would not have resulted in the individual being exposed to infectious aerosols.” But, “out of an abundance of caution,” the employee was referred to occupational medical staff.
In February 2014, a worker in a BSL-2 lab was bitten on the thumb by a mouse infected with both a wild-type strain of Borrelia burgdorferi and a recombinant strain of Borrelia burgdorferi, according to an incident report the lab filed with the NIH. The bacterium causes Lyme disease. The employee did not show any signs of infection, the report says.
Rocky Mountain Laboratories’ history dates back more than 100 years, when scientists came to this area of Montana to investigate a disease locals called “black measles” that was sickening and killing settlers. The disease was Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The labs’ first building was constructed in 1928, according to its website.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill operates six BSL-3/ABSL-3 laboratories, all located on its main campus. Research faculty study several pathogenic microorganisms, some of which are regulated as select agents, wrote Jim Gregory, a university spokesman. Faculty conduct research that aims to reduce the risks associated with either natural infection or potential bioterrorism attacks with select agents. Specific goals include better understanding the pathways of infection and exposure in order to develop more effective treatments and safeguards that protect the public. For example, one research team aims to discover new approaches to protect the public from the coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The team hopes to identify host genes that regulate infections to develop drugs or therapeutics that reduce the severity of these and associated diseases in humans, Gregory wrote. The university has been registered to work with select agents since 2002. The coronavirus that causes SARS is a select agent. Other examples include Yersinia pestis, which caused a recent outbreak of plague in Madagascar. The university reported 16 incidents to the National Institutes of Health from 2012 to 2014 dealing with rDNA research. A series of eight individual mouse escapes over an 18-month period triggered an internal review of procedures and prompted the NIH to demand an action plan. Officials with the NIH called the escapes “concerning.” Several of the mice were infected with eithers SARS or the H1N1 flu virus. </p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Duke University operates one of 12 Regional Biocontainment Laboratories whose construction was partly funded by the National Institutes of Health. The RBL at Duke contains eight BSL-3 and two ABSL-3 suites, said Sarah Avery, director of the Duke Medicine News Office. Duke also operates a single BSL-3 laboratory in its Clinical Microbiology Laboratory. All of the Duke facilities are located on its medical center campus. Researchers have worked with pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Avery said. 
The BSL-3 research is directed broadly at developing drugs, diagnostics and vaccines to protect humans from infectious disease. Duke’s RBL is registered to work with select agents. Recent research with Yersinia pestis involved testing the ability of some novel compounds to kill the bacterium in the test tube, which could lead to developing antibiotics. Recent research with Mycobacterium tuberculosis involved identification of the human antibody response to the surface of the bacterium. A future tuberculosis vaccine may produce these antibodies as a mechanism of protection from tuberculosis infection.
In March 2012, a research worker grazed a needle that was being used to inject multiple zebrafish embryos with wild‐type Mycobacterium marinum, a genetically modified organism, according to documents provided by Richard Frothingham, co-chair of the Duke Institutional Biosafety Committee. The worker did not consider the injury significant and did not report the event at that time. About a week later, the worker noted a small nodule on the index finger of her right hand and reported this to her supervisor. Providers at Duke’s Employee Occupational Health and Wellness (EOHW) office concluded that this likely represented an M. marinum infection and initiated therapy with azithromycin and ethambutol. The worker completed a six-week course of therapy without side effects and was last assessed at EOHW on May 7, 2012, and had no tenderness or loss of function. In June 2012, the biosafety committee minutes from Duke noted that a lab researcher experienced a cut with dissection scissors used to cut up brain tissue from a mouse that had been transfected 12 weeks earlier with a recombinant avian retrovirus. The safety committee reviewed the incident and noted that corrective action was taken.
In May 2014, Duke reported that an employee, while working off-site in a Maryland lab, was exposed to a vector being developed as a potential HIV vaccine described as replication‐deficient, integrase‐defective, VSV‐G pseudotyped lentiviral vector expressing HIV Env. The vector has the potential to induce an immune response that could lead to a false-positive HIV ELISA test. Frothingham said that this did not occur and that there were no complications and no further treatment was necessary.

Researchers focus on vector-borne zoonoses such as ehrlichiosis, bartonellosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Specifically, Rickettsia rickessii, the causative agents of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, requires high-level containment. A group works in the second facility to determine the genetic elements essential for growth of mosquito-vectored viruses in vertebrates and to remove those elements to test as vaccine candidates. Specifically, the West Nile virus and chikungunya virus require high-level containment. The final containment lab works with plant pathogens. The lab is being used to evaluate the survival of food-borne pathogens such as salmonella. NC State is registered for storage of the select-agent plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum in the plant pathogen high-level containment facility. No active work had started on that pathogen as of early 2015.</p>

The facility is located on ECU’s Health Sciences campus. Scientists work with Brucella abortus, a select agent. The causative agent of brucellosis leads to abortions in cattle and undulant fever in humans. As a common zoonosis that is commonly contracted by consuming unpasteurized milk, brucellosis in humans is difficult to treat and there is no human vaccine, Kennedy wrote. The goal of the university’s research is to develop human vaccines to protect against the disease. ECU is registered to work with select agents.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The University of North Dakota has a facility at its REAC 1 Campus facility in Grand Forks with BSL-3, BSL-3-enhanced and ABSL-3 laboratory space but none of those labs has been occupied or used for any BSL-3 agents, Barry Milavetz, interim vice president for research and economic development said in April 2015. The university’s Center of Research Excellence for Avian Therapeutics and Infectious Diseases works on several viruses including West Nile. The center released news in 2014 of a positive reaction to a new antibody technology to cure canine parvovirus. The center’s work with BSL-3 agents is contracted out to a BLS-3 facility located elsewhere, Milavetz said. The projects that require the BSL-3 facilities are part of work with collaborators, he said, and  those collaborators work at other locations because it’s easier. A university website indicates work with Francisella, an intracellular bacterial pathogen and a Centers for Disease and Prevention select agent, but that work was previously done by a faculty member that has not worked with the agent on campus, Milavetz said. All the work done on campus is BSL-1 or BSL-2 containment, he said.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The University of Nebraska operates one BSL-3 lab on its Lincoln campus that is registered to work with select agents, university officials said. According to the 2014 annual report for the university’s National Strategic Research Institute, research includes work related to a vaccine to protect against ricin, a poison found in castor beans that is a potential bioweapon. 
The university initially sought to charge $540 to provide USA TODAY copies of biosafety committee minutes and NIH-reported incident records for its labs in Lincoln and at its medical center in Omaha.
After USA TODAY objected that the charges were excessive and not allowable under the transparency requirements of the NIH Guidelines, the university waived the fees. The university said that although it still believed the fee “is not unreasonable or overly burdensome,” it would “make an exception to its ordinary practice and will not charge for the costs of providing the requested minutes and reports. Please note that this exception is not a waiver of the University’s right to charge an amount sufficient to cover the costs of providing documents in response to public records requests in the future,” wrote Erin Busch, director of university records and associate general counsel.

The BSL-3 labs also are used for processing some specimens from patients treated in the medical center&#39;s biocontainment facility, including some recent Ebola patients.
The university initially sought to charge $540 to provide USA TODAY for copies of biosafety committee minutes and NIH-reported incident records for the medical center and for labs on its main campus in Lincoln. 
After USA TODAY objected that the charges were excessive and not allowable under the transparency requirements of the NIH Guidelines, the university waived the fees. The university said that although it still believed the fee “is not unreasonable or overly burdensome,” it would “make an exception to its ordinary practice and will not charge for the costs of providing the requested minutes and reports.

Some sections of the minutes are redacted in their entirety. In an email, Busch said the redactions were done for security reasons or because the content contained “academic and scientific research work which is in progress and unpublished and other proprietary or commercial information which if released would give advantage to business competitors and serve no public purpose.”

The labs are used for tuberculosis and West Nile virus testing, for viral culturing during influenza surveillance, as well as for examining unknown substances such as white powders, said Kathleen Desmarais of the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (NH DHHS).
In the wake of well-publicized mistakes made in the high-containment labs at both CDC and NIH, the New Hampshire Public Health Laboratories performed an exercise/drill based on these incidents, conducted an inventory of specimens in its labs as part of a federal “Know What’s in Your Freezer” initiative, and has worked with the state’s laboratory response network on education and to assess risks. The NH DHHS does not track BSL-3 or BSL-4 laboratories within the state, Desmarais said.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, founded in 1947, provides biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear research services “to the defense community,” according to the not-for-profit organization’s website. The website emphasizes the organization’s expertise in handling airborne materials and its “extensive ABSL-3 animal exposure facilities.”
Institute officials did not respond to USA TODAY’s requests for interviews about the organization’s BSL-3 labs and incidents. They provided copies of their Institutional Biosafety Committee minutes, as required by the National Institutes of Health. 
The institute’s website notes it is registered with federal officials to work with a wide range of select agents, including anthrax, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, monkeypox virus, ricin, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Francisella tularensis and Yersinia pestis, the bacteria that cause plague.
“Extensive BSL-3 and ABSL-3 level facilities are available for collaborative or contract work with LRRI. The ABSL-3 facilities allow for inhalation exposure of pathogens for efficacy studies. The facilities have been cleared by the CDC for the handling of Select Agents and toxins,” the institute’s website says.
According to the biosafety minutes released by the institute, studies in 2014 included BSL-3 work with Francisella tularensis in vaccine development research. In 2013, minutes indicate BSL-3 work with SARS virus.
In January 2013, a ferret exposed to a genetically manipulated strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza was discovered outside of its primary enclosure inside Lovelace’s BSL-3 facility, biosafety minutes from February 2013 say. According to the records, “a ferret exposed to recombinant A/Vietnam/1203/2004 containing the NS segment of A/HongKong/483/1997 was found outside of its AWAR-defined primary enclosure in the ABSL-3 Facility. The ferret remained contained within an enclosed HEPA filtered Biobubble which is the primary biocontainment.” 
At the time of the ferret incident, technicians were wearing personal protective equipment, including Tyvek suits, double gloves, two pairs of shoe covers, respirators and waterproof aprons, the minutes say. “Per CDC, this was not considered a release since the ferret was still located within the Biobubble,” the minutes say, noting that an incident report was not filed with the CDC select-agent program. Biosafety committee members decided that although the incident involved recombinant materials, it didn’t need to be reported to the NIH as an accident that results in “overt or potential exposures to organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules” because the ferret remained in the “biobubble” and employees were wearing respiratory protection. 
In September 2014, while a routine fire inspection was being performed of a freezer room, an employee noticed an intact vial behind a freezer that had no leaks. The vial was labeled “1/12/2009 Ad3 MUT Stock.” It was disposed of as infectious waste. The biosafety committee discussed whether this incident was reportable to NIH but determined it wasn’t because there was no spill, exposure of personnel and no loss of containment, the minutes say.
The institute, which has 500,000 square feet of facilities, has an annual budget of about $92 million, employs 120 Ph.D.-level scientists plus more than 690 technicians and support staff, according to information on its website.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">In fall 2003, Los Alamos National Laboratory had largely completed construction of a windowless, 3,200-square-foot facility with two BSL-3 labs and one BSL-2 lab. But the lab’s operator, the National Nuclear Security Administration, determined that seismic concerns had not been adequately addressed during the facility’s design, according to environmental impact records for the facility. The lab building, built near a canyon slope on fill material, has remained unused for years, records show. 
In August 2014, the inspector general of the U.S. Department of Energy, which oversees the agency that operates the lab, issued a report raising concerns about the National Nuclear Security Administration’s expansion of biological labs at Los Alamos and about spending around $1.5 million to open the BSL-3 facility and $8 million to construct a BSL-2 facility. “In our judgment, NNSA needs to fully reassess its need for biological research facilities,” the audit said.
In response to questions from USA TODAY, the lab issued a statement in April 2015 saying the decision to operate the BSL-3 facility is undergoing an Environmental Impact Statement process. A public comment period was scheduled for later in 2015. “Through this EIS process the National Nuclear Security Administration will make a decision on start of operations and at what level the facility will operate, either a BSL-3 or BSL-2,” lab officials said.
The Los Alamos National Laboratory was created in 1943 to build an atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project. While the lab’s core mission involves “assuring the safety and reliability of the nation’s nuclear deterrent,” today Los Alamos includes deterrence not only of nuclear threats but of biological terrorist threats, according to the organization’s website.

Officials with the center and the health department did not respond to requests for interviews. 
“The Wadsworth Center has several state of the art high containment laboratories” operating at BSL-3, “including an insectary and small animal space,” its website says. Research includes work relating to potential bioterror agents such as ricin, a potentially deadly toxin, and Yersinia pestis, the bacteria that cause plague, according to researcher profiles on the center’s website and federal funding records. Other pathogens studied include tuberculosis, West Nile virus and Eastern equine encephalitis virus.
The center provided copies of its Institutional Biosafety Committee’s meeting minutes on Jan. 28, 2015 – after USA TODAY filed a formal complaint with the National Institutes of Health, which requires entities receiving certain federal research funding to provide the records to the public on request. USA TODAY had sought the records since Nov. 5, 2014. The Wadsworth Center’s biosafety committee has met only annually in recent years, the records show. The center has not had any NIH-reportable incidents during 2012, 2013 and 2014, center staff said in an email.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The State University of New York at Buffalo operates a single BSL-3 facility on university-owned property. Spokesman John DellaContrada said safety concerns prevent the university from divulging the location of the facility or any specifics about its activities. DellaContrada said the biocontainment facilities seek to develop treatments, vaccines and tests for infectious diseases.
A document on the university’s website says that UB is a leader in the field of biological and chemical defense and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention permits the BSL-3 lab to work with bacillus anthracis, francisella tularenis, brucella species, Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei and Yersinia pestis. 
DellaContrada said the document does not reflect current research goals, but that UB is still permitted to work with these agents. UB is testing for “minimum inhibitory concentrations” of potential anti-microbial therapeutics that its staff and outside organizations are developing. In its lab, UB occasionally tests diagnostic and detection devices developed by outside parties.
The university develops vaccines and boosters to prolong immunity, but does not work with select agents, DellaContrada said.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Cornell University’s select-agent program is limited to using Xanthomonas oryzae, a bacterium that causes a blight of rice, Cornell spokeswoman Melissa Osgood said. Such research take place at Cornell’s Bogdanove Lab.
In 2012, Cornell filed two NIH reports related to its biosafety labs for separate incidents that involved researchers accidentally pricking fingers with a needle. In both cases, the contaminants were strains of Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterium associated with food-borne outbreaks.
The first mishap occurred on March 19, 2012, when a post-doctoral researcher, aided by a lab technician, was vaccinating mice with a recombinant attenuated strain of Listeria monocytogenes. After injecting the mouse with 100 microliters in an intravenous solution, the researcher pricked himself with the needle. The syringe was empty and he had gloves on so the needle barely broke the skin.
The second incident happened on Oct. 12, 2012, when an individual was using the biosafety cabinet to inoculate mice with a wild-type strain of Listeria that was genetically modified to express the gB peptide.
She anesthetized a mouse and was holding it up with her left hand and was about to inject the mouse in the eye when it suddenly moved. The movement startled the individual and she stuck herself in the left index finger.
The reports to NIH told how in both cases the breaks in skin were treated immediately. Osgood said that, while the incubation period for the bacterium can vary, the researchers have not reported any symptoms or adverse effects suggestive of listeriosis, the disease caused by Listeria.

University officials declined to explain how many labs are in use or the general location or the type of work being done in those labs. Spokesman Doug Levy cited protection of proprietary, trade secret information along with institutional and national security as a reason for not disclosing more details about the federally funded research. Minutes released under NIH Guidelines show BSL-3 containment work being done under the oversight of the campus Institutional Biosafety Committee. The Center for Infection and Immunity worked on a project expected to encounter inactivated Nipah virus, a select agent that accounted for more than 100 deaths in an outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore in 1999. The center is located in Washington Heights. The lab specializes in pathogen surveillance and discovery but also sponsors projects related to neuropsychiatric disorders and the preservation of habitats and natural resources, according to its website. In 2014, the university advertised for a biological safety officer to manage the university&#39;s select-agents program/BSL-3 and ABSL-3 facilities.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Located off the tip of Long Island, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center focuses on developing diagnostic tests, vaccines and treatments for foreign animal diseases that primarily affect cattle, pigs and sheep.
It is operated by the Department of Homeland Security in partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The center has one BSL-3 laboratory, said DHS spokesman John Verrico. The center is registered to work with select agents that affect animals, and it maintains a livestock vaccine bank, he said. 
The diseases studied at the center do not affect people, but could be devastating to livestock herds and, as a result, the food supply and the economy, said DHS in a statement. Much of the center’s research has focused on foot-and-mouth disease, considered one of the most economically devastating livestock diseases in the world. The disease was eradicated in the United States in 1929, but still exists in Africa, South America and Asia, according to the USDA.
Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious virus that infects animals with cloven or divided hooves, such as cows, pigs, sheep, goats and deer. Infected animals have fever and painful blisters on their tongues, lips and inside their mouths, as well as around their hooves and mammary glands. Although most of these animals won’t die from the disease, they suffer from lameness and stop eating, leaving them weakened and affecting their ability to produce milk and meat, according to the USDA. The virus is spread through body excretions and even by an infected animal’s breath, and it can survive on contaminated soil or other materials for months. 
Documents obtained by USA TODAY under the federal Freedom of Information Act show nine incidents at Plum Island’s labs during 2013 and 2014. 
In April 2013, a plate containing Foot-and-mouth-disease virus caught on a scientist’s sleeve and fell to the floor. The plate “landed right side up with the lid slightly ajar. The majority of the media (EMEM, virus dilution, and cells) were still in the plate,” the report says. Paper towels containing a bleach solution were placed on top of the spill for a minimum of 20 minutes, then autoclaved. The 1-foot area where the spill occurred was then bleached again. The report notes that the virus is not infectious to humans and that the spill was contained within the enhanced BSL-3 lab space.
In February 2013, a student in the center’s foreign animal disease diagnostic course was “nipped” by a pig that appears, based on the redacted records, to have been involved in an African swine fever study. African swine fever virus causes a hemorrhagic disease in pigs that has a high death rate. The student was wearing a protective Tyvek suit and reported her skin being “pinched” and finding a “scant amount of blood” on the inside of the suit. An antibiotic was applied to the wound, and a doctor ordered blood tests to check for potential rabies exposure. There was no evidence of infection, the report says.
DHS, in the records it initially released to USA TODAY, redacted the names of some pathogens from incident reports and biosafety committee minutes claiming that a federal bioterrorism law prohibited their disclosure. After USA TODAY appealed, the agency released the pathogen names. “After further review of these records, we have determined that our withholding of information pursuant to FOIA exemption (b)(3) Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 also known as the Bioterrorism Act was asserted in error.” Many other redactions remain in the records. 
Plum Island maintains enhanced BSL-3 equipment and procedures, according to the center’s website. Those include a sewage decontamination plant, incineration of trash and requirements that staff change clothes and “many times throughout the work day when going between animal rooms.” The facilities use negative air pressure and staff monitoring of air-handling systems to ensure biocontainment is maintained. 
“All employees and visitors of the laboratory facilities (not the administrative building) must agree to a Personal Recognizant Quarantine to preclude them for a defined period from going to livestock holding areas on the mainland that contain cloven-hoofed animals,” the website says.
The Plum Island Animal Disease Center has been in operation since 1954, and DHS has announced plans to replace it with a new National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility in Manhattan, Kan.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The University of Rochester operates one BSL-3 laboratory located on the medical center campus. The facility is not located near patient care areas, wrote Christopher DiFrancesco, a university spokesman. The lab works on two organisms, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Francisella tularensis. The lab focuses on investigating drug resistance of the TB organism to aid in development of new drugs for treatment. For Francisella, the lab is investigating how the organism avoids detection by the immune system. This information may be applicable to other infectious bacteria. The lab is registered to work with select agents; Francisella is one.
Francisella tularensis, DiFrancesco said, was last used in 2009, with UR opting instead for less dangerous species of francisella to study tularemia, which occurs when a person is infected with the bacterium francisella tularensis. But UR keeps this select agent on hand because certain experiments require it. If a grant application to the National Institutes of Health is approved, francisella tularensis would be used again in research.
UR also uses two toxins — tetrodotoxin (used in neurology research) and staphylococcal enterotoxins (used in immunology research) — that are select agents but do not cause or spread infection and are in such small amounts that they do not have to be registered with the federal government.</p>

        <p class="byline"> by Alison Young</p> 
        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Battelle, which bills itself as “the world’s largest nonprofit research and development organization,” has 39 BSL-3 labs at the organization’s West Jefferson, Ohio, facility, Battelle said in a statement in response to USA TODAY’s questions.
Those 22,000 square feet of BSL-3 lab space make Battelle “the largest private BSL-3 containment laboratory in the United States,” the organization’s website says. Battelle does biomedical research for government, industry and academia.
In West Jefferson, Battelle does effectiveness and safety testing of vaccines and other compounds to prevent or treat infectious diseases and biological threats. Pathogens used in research at the facility include influenza and anthrax, and the labs are registered to work with select agents, the organization said.
As a private organization, Battelle is not directly subject to state or federal open records laws that would require it to release copies of lab accident reports. It also has organized its internal biosafety oversight committees in a way that shields much of its research from public review.
Instead of having a single biosafety committee to oversee research, Battelle has set up two. One committee reviews research involving just recombinant DNA experiments that involve genetically manipulated organisms. Such research represents a subset of the work done at the facility. The minutes of this Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), as a condition of federal research funding, are subject to public transparency requirements of the NIH Guidelines. Battelle released these IBC minutes to USA TODAY, but they don’t contain any information about BSL-3 research.
Battelle says that’s because none of the work done in the BSL-3 labs involved recombinant DNA research during 2013 and 2014, the period covered by USA TODAY’s request. The NIH Guidelines focus on requirements for conducting recombinant DNA research and transparency about that research.
Battelle has set up a separate biosafety committee that oversees all research that doesn’t involve recombinant DNA experiments. That’s the committee that oversaw all of the BSL-3 work in West Jefferson during 2013 and 2014. Battelle declined to release minutes from this committee.
“Like other entities and companies, we are bound by contractual obligations, non-disclosure agreements and national security guidelines to protect certain information. Due to these obligations, the minutes are not publicly available,” Battelle said in a statement.
Battelle said it had no NIH-reportable incidents involving recombinant DNA experiments during the three-year period, from 2012 through 2014, covered in USA TODAY’s document request.
In response to questions about lab incidents involving other types of research, Battelle said: “During 2013 and 2014, Battelle reported fewer than a dozen select-agent-related incidents to the CDC. Most of these incidents involved laboratory container breakage, working material labeling errors, or needlesticks. None resulted in a laboratory-acquired infection.”
USA TODAY was unable to get the incident reports Battelle filed with CDC. The CDC denied other requests by USA TODAY under the federal Freedom of Information Act for select-agent incident reports citing language that Congress put in the Public Health Preparedness and Bioterrorism Act of 2002. It says that certain specified federal agencies, including CDC, shall not disclose “any notification of a release of a listed agent or toxin submitted under subsections (b) and (c) of this section, or any notification of theft or loss submitted under such subsections.”
Battelle said its labs address problems when incidents happen.
“Battelle’s research operations are highly regulated and inspected by various government agencies and accrediting institutions. As part of our lab operations, if an event occurs (including ‘near miss’ events), an investigation is conducted which focuses on the incident’s cause and identification of possible corrective actions to eliminate or reduce the potential for recurrence,” the organization said in its statement to USA TODAY.
Battelle, also called the Battelle Memorial Institute, was founded in 1929 and is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. It has more than 22,000 employees at more than 60 locations around the world. Its many activities include providing scientific and administrative services to support research at the NIAID Integrated Research Facility, another high-containment laboratory operated by the National Institutes of Health in Fort Detrick, Md. 
In its fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2013, Battelle had nearly $4.8 billion in revenue, according to its most recent IRS non-profit tax return posted at Guidestar.org.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, operates one BSL-3 laboratory and is constructing a second one, wrote Laura McGowan, a base spokeswoman. The labs are part of the 711th Human Performance Wing and located on the base. The operational BSL-3 facility is aimed at research, but no active projects are being conducted. The second, under construction, will be diagnostic. The labs do not receive National Institutes of Health funding, so McGowan said it does not fall under NIH Guidelines. The lab is registered to work with select agents but does not have any active research. McGowan wrote that the BSL-3 facilities can handle risk groups 2 and 3 microbial agents, including select agents.</p>

About 50 weeks per year, the lab is operated as a BSL-2. No BSL-3 research is conducted at Kent State. Scientists use BSL-2 surrogates of BSL-3 microorganisms, but not the BSL-3 agents themselves. “We study methods for detection and control of bacteria,” Woolverton wrote. “For example, we invented a liquid crystal biosensor several years ago. We have also tested electron beam energy and cold plasma as decontamination strategies.” The lab is not registered to work with select agents.</p>

These services include guidance and training for detection and identification of a terrorist event, and training, technical assistance and consultation for Oklahoma’s private clinical laboratories.”
The Public Health Laboratory is a member of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Laboratory Response Network (LRN). These labs perform everything from routine diagnostic testing to the identification of potential chemical or bioterrorism agents. The LRN established safety protocols and procedures, which the Public Health Lab rigorously follows, the statement went on to say.

James said OSU researchers are approved to work with: Macacine herpesvirus I, Rickettsia rickettsii, botulinum neurotoxin producing strains of Clostridium, Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, Rickettsia prowazekii, Yersinia pestis, Bacillus anthracis, Brucella abortus, Brucella melitensis, Brucella suis, Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei. The work is performed to understand molecular basis for their pathogenicity, develop diagnostic assays, test new decontaminants or better understand the interaction between the pathogens and their host cells to aid in development of therapeutic, vaccine and diagnostic platforms, James said. OSI is registered with the Federal Select Agent Program to possess, use and transfer select agents and toxins, James said.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The University of Pennsylvania has one operational BSL-3 lab and does not work with animals there, according to the Office of the Vice Provost for Research. The lab is located on the main campus in a medical school research building. The university is not registered to work with select agents. Among its research studies: Two scientists, Robert Doms and Paul Bates, are working with Andes virus and Puumala virus, which are spread by aerosolization of infected rodent stool and urine and cause hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) or hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), respectively. These can be highly lethal diseases with case fatality rates up to 35% for HCPS, according to information provided by Karen Kreeger, senior science communications manager at the university. The labs are identifying host factors required for infection by these viruses and aim to develop effective prophylactic or therapeutic strategies.</p>

The RBL is one of 13 RBLs whose construction was funded by the National Institutes of Health. The facility supports research and the national biodefense network and includes BSL-3 and ABSL-3 level labs, the website notes. Researchers work on developing vaccines and therapeutics to combat a variety of pathogenic agents that affect human health. The work includes aerobiology, imaging and immunopathology, and the pathogens fall into all three BSL-3 categories (A, B and C). Scientists at the center have worked on research to combat everything from SARS and AIDS to Rift Valley fever and the chikungunya virus, according to information posted on the website. John Fedele, senior associate director of news, said in an email: “Because of the sensitive nature of the type of research being conducted at the facilities you&#39;ve inquired about, we do not typically share specifics of the information you&#39;ve requested.”</p>

The Pell Laboratory will begin experiments later in 2015, working with diseases and animal vaccines, said Bill Greer, associate director of the university’s Office of Research Protections. The first experiments will involve tularemia, a bacterial disease spread to humans through insect and rodent bites, Henneman said. The bacteria can cause skin lesions and cough and chest pain similar to pneumonia, according to the CDC.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">South Dakota State University has one BSL-3 holding facility consisting of two rooms in its animal unit located on its Brookings campus, said Norm Braaten, research compliance coordinator for the facility. The holding facility could be used if something BSL-3-related were to occur, where a subject could be moved or held there, Braaten said.  
The university’s website describes the facilities as being part of the Animal Resource Wing maintained by the school’s Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences. The 19,898-square-foot structure contains both BSL-2 and BSL-3 animal facilities for both large and laboratory animals and separate suites available for gnotobiology, animal surgery and necropsy.
The facility’s research labs operate no higher than BSL-2. Facility employees recently destroyed a few select agents and discontinued its select-agent registration, which Braaten described as small reference samples that were part of a federally funded diagnostic lab but not used in research. The facility’s biosafety committee minutes for Sept. 19, 2014, show it reviewed and approved protocols for the generation of a reverse genetics system for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, a livestock disease.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The Tennessee Department of Health uses its BSL-3 capabilities to work with tuberculosis, federal select agents and infectious diseases that require aerosol protection, said Woody McMillin, director of communications for the department. The Department of Health is one of four facilities in the state with BSL-3 labs. Although the department does not directly track the other labs, it does license the services the facilities provide and regulate some work that would be considered high-containment, McMillin said. In addition to periodic inspections by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through the Federal Select Agent Program, the state labs conduct some of their own training exercises and partner with Oak Ridge National Laboratory for others. If accidents involving select agents do happen, the Department of Health voluntarily reports that information to the Tennessee Department of Homeland Security and to the Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Administration, when necessary.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">St. Jude Children&#39;s Research Hospital in Memphis operates two BSL-3 laboratories and one ABSL-3 laboratory. They are located on the main campus of the hospital in downtown Memphis but are separate from patient care buildings, spokeswoman Emily Gest wrote in an email. Scientists do research on influenza and focus on pandemic strains that could pose a global health threat. The labs work with avian influenza and velogenic Newcastle disease virus.
In May 2014, a worker in an enhanced BSL-3 lab discovered that five ferrets had escaped their cage. The ferrets had been inoculated a week earlier with the deadly H7N9 avian influenza virus but didn’t show symptoms, according to a report of the incident. This strain of bird flu, first identified in 2013, has caused severe respiratory illness in people and about one-third of those sickened have died. As the worker put the ferrets back in their cage, she discovered a tear in her double gloves and a small cut on a finger. The worker’s risk of infection was deemed “very low,” and blood tests showed no signs of infection. According to the report, the research was overseen by Richard Webby.
In June 2014, St. Jude’s biosafety committee approved a new project proposed by Webby to do a controversial type of research that the minutes say has the “high likelihood of conferring enhancements” – in other words, making more dangerous – strains of avian influenza virus that have a low ability to produce disease. USA TODAY reported on this research and the May incident in a September 2014 article.
In October 2014, the U.S. government issued a “research funding pause” on certain gain-of-function research involving influenza, MERS and SARS viruses while federal officials examine the risks and benefits of these types of experiments.
In August 2013, Webby was among several co-signers of a letter in the journal Nature arguing that controversial “gain of function” experiments are needed on the H7N9 virus to understand its potential to cause a pandemic if it were to mutate naturally. Other scientists oppose the work as too dangerous.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Vanderbilt University operates three BSL-3 labs on its campus, said Robert Wheaton, executive director of the school’s Environmental Health and Safety department. Scientists are conducting basic and/or applied biomedical research on SARS, MERS, tuberculosis and chikungunya. The Vanderbilt Meharry Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) is one of the BSL-3 facilities, according to a university website. Another university page says the Immunopathogenesis Core at CFAR houses a cell sorter and laser confocal microscope in a BSL-3 area, which allows for the study of biohazardous or infectious samples. </p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The Texas Department of State Health Services’ main lab in Austin has BSL-3 facilities that are used for work with influenza, West Nile virus, tuberculosis and botulism, said spokeswoman Carrie Williams. The lab has a bio-threat area that is used as needed, she said. The health department also has BSL-3 facilities at its South Texas Laboratory in Harlingen.
Other labs operating across Texas are not required to be certified by the state health department, Williams said. However, she said, “We periodically make contact with Texas labs so we have a general sense of what is out there.” The informal list kept by the department includes about 16 facilities, primarily hospitals and medical centers, that have identified themselves as having a BSL-3 lab.  
If a laboratory incident results in an illness that’s on the state’s list of notifiable conditions, the health department will receive a report from health care providers, she said. Select-agent-related illnesses are included on the state’s notifiable diseases list. There is no reporting requirement, however, for labs that have a potential accidental release, such as a missing specimen vial or breach of containment, she said.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Texas A&amp;M University has two BSL-3 labs at facilities in College Station/Bryan, said Lane Stephenson, the university’s director of news and information services. In addition, a building under construction will include a third BSL-3 lab for use by the Texas A&amp;M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, he said.
The university declined to grant an interview about the type of research it does in its BSL-3 labs, its approach to biosafety or the incidents its labs have reported in recent years. “Regarding other aspects of your inquiry, we think the information provided in response to your earlier FOI request is sufficient,” Stephenson said in an email.
In 2007, Texas A&amp;M became the first select-agent laboratory to be ordered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to halt work with select agents in the wake of inspectors finding serious biosafety issues and the university’s failure to report incidents, according to testimony to Congress that year by the Government Accountability Office. The issues were discovered after the Sunshine Project, a non-profit watchdog group, revealed that a lab worker was exposed to Brucella bacteria, a potential bioterror agent, while cleaning an aerosol chamber after an experiment and later became ill. “But no report was subsequently made to the CDC as required by federal regulation and a year passed before … [the Sunshine Project] uncovered the lapse in reporting and forced TAMU to notify the CDC,” the GAO reported in 2007. When the CDC investigated, it found numerous violations, including that the university wasn’t authorized to aerosolize Brucella and that multiple workers from a different BSL-3 lab had tested positive for antigens to Coxiella, another select agent that causes Q fever – but those potential exposures had never been reported to regulators, the GAO said.
Records obtained by USA TODAY show Texas A&amp;M has regularly reported incidents in recent years, even promptly contacting NIH officials to alert them of mishaps that may not require reports.
As required under the transparency requirements of the NIH Guidelines as a condition of its federal research funding, Texas A&amp;M University released copies of its Institutional Biosafety Committee minutes for 2013 and 2014, plus reports of incidents involving recombinant DNA experiments during 2012, 2013 and 2014.The documents include reports sent by Texas A&amp;M to officials at the NIH about two dozen incidents involving potential exposures, animal bites, needle sticks, equipment failures and experiments that were conducted without proper approvals in labs of all biosafety levels. Not all types of lab incidents have to be reported to the NIH – only those involving certain research with genetically modified organisms, and therefore the released reports reflect only incidents from a subset of the university’s research. In 2013, the reports show, Texas A&amp;M’s BSL-3 suites had repeated issues with power failures that resulted in the labs losing negative air pressure, a key biosafety feature that is among several used to keep pathogens contained inside the lab. On May 6, 2013, a brief commercial power outage or voltage drop caused the BSL-3’s HVAC air-handling system to shut down around 10 p.m. Because of the short duration of the anomaly, power didn’t transfer to the backup generator, the university’s biosafety officer told the NIH. During the three to four minutes it took to restore full HVAC systems, “the BL3 suite did become positively pressurized with respect to the adjacent space,” the biosafety officer said. No work with any infectious materials were taking place during the outage, the university said, adding that staff was investigating the root cause of the incident.
On May 10, 2013, the university’s biosafety officer told the NIH that after another bad storm the previous night, the BSL-3 lab again experienced a brief power outage. “The engineers were able to reset the BSL-3 within seconds of it going off line, but a couple of rooms in the suite went briefly positive. I do not know whether this brief outage resulted in a true reversal of airflow or loss of containment. No one was working in the lab at the time,” the biosafety officer wrote, detailing a variety of actions the university was taking. “Effective immediately, operations in the BL3 lab have ceased,” the biosafety officer wrote, adding that the lab would be decontaminated with vaporized hydrogen peroxide and that numerous tests and engineering fixes were planned.
On May 31, 2013, the biosafety officer sent an email to the NIH saying building engineers had fixed the issues and the BSL-3 lab had been reopened. “We are confident that power outages will not be a problem in this lab,” the email said, but noted that, as a precaution, the lab had instituted a plan at the time to not conduct research in the BSL-3 suite during significant weather events.
On Nov. 1, 2013, the biosafety officer reported another airflow failure in one of the university’s active BSL-3 labs where research with recombinant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are used. Because the incident occurred at 7:30 a.m., no work was being done at the time, the email says. Building engineers discovered that a “module controlling the exhaust damper actuator failed. This equipment failure resulted in the exhaust damper sticking in the closed position and, as a result, the lab went briefly positive to the adjoining lab room. Infected animals are housed in this room, however I want to emphasize that no work was taking place at that time in the BSL3 suite – no one was physically present in the lab.” The part was replaced and the room’s negative air pressure restored, the biosafety officer told the NIH. NIH officials, in letters, told the university that its responses to the incidents were appropriate.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The Galveston National Laboratory, located on the campus of the University of Texas Medical Branch-Galveston, has two BSL-4 labs and multiple BSL-3 labs, said spokesman Raul Reyes. 
The lab’s biosafety committee minutes note discussions during 2014 of BSL-3 research involving pathogens such as Yersinia pestis, West Nile virus, the H7N9 avian influenza virus, wild-type yellow fever virus and Rickettsia conorii; and BSL-4 research involving Ebola, Marburg, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever, Sabia virus and Guanarito.
The lab had no NIH-reportable incidents involving recombinant DNA exposures from 2012 through early December 2014, the time period of USA TODAY’s records request, said Dee Zimmerman, the lab’s biosafety officer. 
But the lab had incidents during other kinds of research and posts summaries of them on its website. The routine posting of lab incident information is rare in the research industry. Galveston National Lab officials said it’s an important part of being transparent with its community.
Among the posted incident summaries: In June 2013, an employee was bitten by a non-human primate involved in an experiment with Nipah virus, a BSL-4 pathogen, while removing the animal from a cage. The employee was treated with an antibody and no illness resulted. 
In November 2012, an employee working with Kyasanur Forest disease virus, a BSL-4 pathogen, experienced a needle stick after filling a syringe. “Exposure dose determined to be low. Employee previously immunized for Tick Borne encephalitis virus, which may have provided cross protection,” the summary says.
In March 2013, the lab publicly disclosed that a small plastic vial of Guanarito virus – which can cause a deadly hemorrhagic fever and is considered to be a potential bioterror pathogen – was missing from a locked freezer. The virus is worked with in BSL-4 labs by scientists in full-body protective suits. The lab said the most likely explanation for the missing vial was that it became stuck to a researcher’s glove while items were removed from the freezer and that it dropped unnoticed to the lab’s floor, rolled under equipment and was later swept up and incinerated with other lab waste.
The lab’s posted incident summaries go back to 2002. They are online at: www.utmb.edu/gnl/safety/report.shtml 
The CDC’s select agent program was at the facility for five days in June 2014 for its annual BSL-4 inspection, according to the organization’s biosafety committee minutes from that month. “There were a few minor inventory paperwork discrepancies that were resolved during the inspection week,” the minutes say. “The inspectors noted a person in the lab wearing earrings, the BSL4 Biosafety Manual states no jewelry in the lab.”

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The Texas Biomedical Research Institute operates a lab complex that includes the nation’s only privately owned BSL-4 facility. The organization notes that it is also “the only institution in the country to house both a BSL-4 lab and a national primate research center.”
Research in the institute’s BSL-4 lab includes work with the deadly Ebola virus to develop better detection and treatment methods, the organization says. The institute, which also has BSL-3 and -2 labs, is registered to work with select agents.
The institute’s BSL-4 facility was constructed in 1999 and became operational in March 2000. BSL-4 labs are the highest level of containment and are used for research involving the most deadly of pathogens, which have no cures. BSL-4 labs have safety features that include scientists wearing spacesuit-like full-body protective gear with filtered air supplies.
In response to questions from USA TODAY, the institute said its scientists work to develop vaccines and therapies against viral pathogens. “Scientists in the BSL3 laboratory study pathogens such as HIV, West Nile virus, Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) and Yersinia pestis (plague) among others. The BSL4 laboratory is used to study pathogens for which there is currently no vaccine and no cure available. In the BSL4 laboratory we study such pathogens as Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Lassa Fever virus, Sudan virus, and SARS,” the institute said in an email.
As a private organization, the institute is not directly subject to state or federal open records laws. It provided copies of its “Recombinant DNA Committee” meeting minutes to USA TODAY, as it is required under the NIH Guidelines as a condition of federal funding. The institute had no incidents reportable to the National Institutes of Health during 2012 through late 2014, said Robert Davey, chairman of the institute’s Institutional Recombinant DNA and Nucleic Acids Committee, in an email.
The documents provided cover only a subset of research at the institute that involves experiments involving genetic manipulations subject to the NIH Guidelines. The institute did not respond to USA TODAY’s questions regarding how many incidents it had during 2012-2014 that weren’t required to be reported to the NIH. Nor would it say what kinds of issues or incidents its labs have had and whether any were significant.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The University of Texas-San Antonio has two BSL-3 facilities on its main campus, said spokeswoman Christi Fish. The labs are used to study three pathogens for the purpose of vaccine development: Francisella tularensis, Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii. 
Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii are types of fungus that cause a disease known as Valley fever or Coccidioidomycosis. The fungus is found in soil in the southwestern United States, especially in certain areas of Arizona and California, as well as in parts of Mexico and South America, according to the Centers for the Disease Control and Prevention.
Fish said that one of the university’s BSL-3 labs, where the research with Francisella tularensis is done, is registered to work with select agents. This highly infectious bacterium causes tularemia, a disease of both animals and people. The bacteria naturally are found in rodents, rabbits and other animals and can spread through tick bites and direct contact.
Francisella tularensis is listed as a select agent because of its potential to be made airborne and cause disease with exposure to just a small number of organisms, according to the CDC. If an infectious aerosol were inhaled, it could cause severe respiratory illness, including life-threatening pneumonia, the agency says.
During the university’s Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) meeting in February 2013, members received a presentation on the “top five biosafety deficiencies” found in an annual lab safety evaluation of labs of all biosafety levels. They were:
1. Not having an IBC approval on file or lacking an approval that was current for the research. 
2. Medical waste not stored properly, “which was usually overfilled medical waste containers.”
3. Media flasks stored outside of the biosafety cabinet.
4. Chairs not covered with a non-porous material.
5. Hand-washing facilities not adequate because there was no soap at the sink or the sink was inaccessible.

Lane Stephenson, director of news and information services for the university, declined to grant an interview or provide information about research done at the facility. “The TVMDL facility in Amarillo does not include an operational BSL-3 lab,” he said in an email. “Rather, it is an operational BSL-2 lab with the capability of switching to BSL-3 status, if necessary.”
Stephenson would not elaborate on why the lab isn’t currently operational as a BSL-3. According to the strategic plan for the Texas A&amp;M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory program for 2011 to 2015, the Amarillo BSL-3 was under construction and scheduled for completion in spring 2011. It was built because of the “importance of animal agriculture in the Texas Panhandle,” the document says.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Dugway Proving Ground, located on nearly 800,000 acres of land about 75 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, is a major test facility for the U.S. Army’s chemical and biological defense programs. 
The Army operates a suite of six BSL-3 labs at the facility that are used in its testing of equipment to detect pathogens and evaluation of decontamination methods, said spokeswoman Sheryl Grubb. The BSL-3 labs are located in a remote area 17 miles from the proving ground’s main campus, she said. Pathogens used in these tests include anthrax bacteria; Yersinia pestis, which causes plague; botulinum toxin and ricin.
According to 2012 and 2013 Army capabilities reports for Dugway Proving Ground, the facility has an aerosol test chamber for BSL-3 organisms and a microbiology branch that can produce large or small quantities of biological agents, including select agents that have the potential for use as bioweapons, or for use in research or field tests. The “materials are produced in BSL-3 facilities as challenge material for biodefense testing under strict operating procedures and stored in secured refrigerators, freezers, or incubators within the Bioholdings Laboratory,” the 2012 report said.
Examples of other materials produced have included monkeypox virus, Francisella tularensis, Brucella abortus, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Coxiella burnetii and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, the 2012 report said.
In response to a Freedom of Information Act request seeking reports of any lab incidents in 2013 or 2014, the Army released three reports involving chemical weapons agents inside its labs. The containment level of the labs and the purpose of the research is not noted in the documents.
On April 15, 2013, two workers were performing maintenance on equipment in Lab 36  “when off-gassing occurred” and VX was detected in the room, according to the incident report. “Operators did not exhibit any signs or symptoms of chemical agent exposure and have reported to the US Army Health Clinic Dugway Proving Ground as a precautionary measure. A local safety investigation will be initiated to determine the cause of this chemical event.” VX is a man-made chemical warfare agent classified as a nerve agent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. VX, which is odorless and tasteless, was developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1950s and its only known use is as a chemical warfare agent, the CDC says.
Later the same day, another report shows, two operators entered Lab 63 wearing M40 gas masks to assess a “test fixture.” While they were troubleshooting the fixture, “a small amount of liquid was observed within the fume hood and tested positive for GD.” As the operators were exiting the room, monitors detected the nerve agent “and the hoods were placed into manual over-ride. The observed spill was decontaminated before exiting the room.” The report says no personnel were exposed.
GD, which is also called soman, is a man-made chemical warfare agent classified as a nerve agent, according to the CDC. It was originally developed as an insecticide in Germany in 1944.
In January 2013, there was another incident in Lab 63 with GD-soman, records show. Vapors from the agent were detected while a laboratory test fixture was operating. “No operators were present within the room during the chemical event,” the report says. “No danger to the public or environment. An assessment will be conducted to determine cause of engineering control and test fixture failure.”
According to the Army’s capabilities reports for Dugway Proving Ground, VX and other chemical agents are used in chamber and field testing of “chem-bio defense systems.”

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Utah State University operates three ABLS-3 laboratories in Logan for the purpose of conducting anti-viral and vaccine research, wrote Steven Biloao, director of the university’s environmental health and safety department. The research is conducted with mice, hamsters and guinea pigs. Two of the ABSL-3 labs are located on the main USU campus in the Laboratory Animal Research Center and the third lab is about 1.5 miles off campus in the BioInnovations Center. The school’s Institute for Antiviral Research has received funding from the Department of Defense, the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Mental Health. The labs also contract with private pharmaceutical and research companies for “fee-for-service testing,” Bilbao wrote. The university is registered to work with select agents.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Virginia’s Department of General Services operates a BSL-3 laboratory at its Virginia Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services. It is used for testing for pathogens such as tuberculosis, suspected strains of influenza that may pose an unusual threat, MERS-CoV, rabies virus and other agents that might pose a biological threat, said Rhonda Bishton of the department of general services.
Neither the state lab nor the Virginia Department of Health “require registration or have the ability to determine the biosafety level for laboratories in Virginia,” said Michelle Stoll, a health department spokeswoman. 
If a lab reports an incident to the Federal Select Agent Program, Virginia’s health department receives a copy of it “unless the laboratory transfers or destroys the agent within 7 days of identifying it or within 90 days of receiving it for proficiency testing,” she said in an email. State regulations require labs to send the department an annual update to the state and submit reports if a select agent is suspected to have been released, lost or stolen, Stoll said. When the health department has received reports of lab accidents at select agent facilities, it “has worked with those facilities to assure there is no risk to the population,” she said. 
In the past five years, however, the health department has received zero reports from labs of possible release, loss or theft of select agents, said spokeswoman Maribeth Brewster in an August 2014 email.

John Pastor, director of research communications for Virginia Tech, said scientists there study non-select agent viruses, risk group 3 bacteria and zoonotic agents. The work looks at how a microbe is transmitted between species of animals and involves the development of vaccines. The facility is registered to work with select agents on vaccine and biosensor development. The university has four biosafety officers, an industrial hygienist and a biosafety trainer.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">George Mason University’s Biomedical Research Laboratory houses a containment suite for work at the BSL-3 or ABSL-3 level. The lab is located in a secure, stand-alone facility on a 10-acre site adjacent to the university’s Prince William campus in Manassas. The work there involves bacterial and viral pathogens such as Burkholderia, Rift Valley fever, and encephalitic alpha viruses (Venezuelan and Eastern equine encephalitis,) said Michael Sandler, director of strategic communications at George Mason. The purpose of the research is to develop drugs to treat disease, vaccines to prevent diseases and techniques to diagnose disease, Sandler says. The facility is registered to work with select agents related to diagnosing, treating and preventing disease.
George Mason University initially sought to charge USA TODAY $167.65 for copies of its Institutional Biosafety Committee minutes and NIH-reportable incident records, which it is required to make public as a condition of its federal research funding. When USA TODAY objected to the fee as excessive for just 114 pages of records and asked for an itemized accounting, the university sent a copy of handwritten notes someone had written on lined paper that claimed even higher costs to release the records: $422.61. The bulk of that cost involved two highly paid employees spending five hours each to review the records before release, the record said. A third employee spent two hours on the records, the university’s breakdown said.
When USA TODAY asked for the dates and times these long reviews occurred, the university said the employees didn’t log their time. However the university told USA TODAY it was reducing its fee to $100.59 because it had learned that some of the charges involved the employees meeting with each other about the newspaper’s request. USA TODAY filed a formal appeal with the NIH on Jan. 9, 2015, saying the fees were excessive and violated the NIH Guidelines’ transparency requirements. Five days later, the university sent an email saying it was reducing its charges to $25.
“The University would like to note that this is a one-time reduction in cost, and that the cost of future FOIA requests to the University will be calculated according to Virginia law,” wrote Elizabeth Woodley, the university’s FOIA compliance officer.
The reduction was a result of USA TODAY’s appeal to the NIH. “Yes, after consultation with NIH, we decided to further reduce the charge,” Woodley said in another email.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">SRI International, a non-profit research firm that works for government and industry, operates a BSL-3 facility at its Shenandoah Valley center in Harrisonburg and another on its headquarters campus in Menlo Park, Calif., said spokeswoman Rebecca Michals.
Although Michals would not say which pathogens are used in research at the facilities, SRI’s website says the Shenandoah Valley center does virology research relating to therapies and vaccines for influenza, SARS-CoV, hantaviruses and poxviruses, as well as studies of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. 
SRI redacted names of many pathogens from the minutes of its Institutional Biosafety Committee, which oversees research at both sites, before releasing them to USA TODAY. The firm said it could not disclose names of pathogens in its research designated as select agents, because of their potential for use as bioweapons. Yet on its website and in press releases, SRI International has touted its research involving several select agents, including anthrax, plague, tularemia and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, as well as ricin, botulinum toxins and abrin, a poison.
SRI International had more than $566 million in revenue during 2012, according to its most recent non-profit tax return posted on Guidestar, an online website that collects tax returns from IRS-registered non-profit groups.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Vermont’s Public Health Laboratory has one BSL-3 lab that is used on an as-needed basis to test for select agents that pose a potential biothreat, said lab director Stella Celotti.
The state health department’s lab is the only BSL-3 lab in the state and also the only select-agent-registered lab, Celotti said in a September 2014 email.

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">The university will be operating three labs capable of BSL-3/ABSL-3 research in 2015 once the labs are commissioned. The labs are located within the Vermont Department of Health’s Public Health Laboratory at the Colchester Business and Technology Park. The facility opened in December 2014. The university does not have any research plans to release because protocols have not been approved. The university does not anticipate registering to use select agents, said Enrique Corredera, a university spokesman.</p>

        <p class="text chatt lab-body">Washington State University operates two BSL-3 labs at its Pullman campus, wrote Kathy Barnard, a university spokeswoman. Only one is actively used. The kinds of pathogens used in research at WSU include animal, plant and human agents or engineered viral vector systems. The primary purpose of this research is to sustain human, animal and plant health and to improve agricultural and food safety and to identify bio-engineered sources of renewable energy, Barnard wrote. The university is investigating the molecular mechanisms of sleep response to viral infections with strains of influenza virus. The labs are also investigating the virulence factors of Manheimia (Pasteurella) Haemolytica and Mycoplasma Ovipneumoniae to identify control strategies of big horn sheep diseases. The labs work with scrapie and chronic waiting disease prions and small ruminant lentivirus (SLRV). On the plant side, the labs work with wheat, barley and biofuel diseases including these agents: Gaeumannomyces graminis, Pythium spp., Rhizoctonia spp., Fusariumspp., Heterodera spp., Pratylenchus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Xanthomonas spp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. WSU is registered to work with Brucella abortus, a select agent. It is amending its select agent registration to include Coxiella burnetii, the bacteria that causes Q fever.</p>
