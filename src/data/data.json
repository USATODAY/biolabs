When new illnesses emerge, such as MERS-CoV and swine flu, public health labs are among the first in the country to receive test methods to diagnose these new diseases, said department spokesman Donn Moyer. The TB lab is used routinely on weekdays, Moyer said. The emergency response lab gets about 50-60 specimens per year, most of them being human clinical specimens. \n\nIn 2003 the state lab commissioned an independent security assessment and took several steps to enhance security at that time including installation of security cameras and restricting staff access in certain areas, Moyer said. In 2008, the lab commissioned an independent safety and risk assessment to evaluate any potential hazards the lab facility might pose to the community. That report, Moyer said, found the labs were in compliance with regulations and were unlikely to pose a hazard to the surrounding community. More recently, the lab has been working to conduct exercises of response plans with local law enforcement to ensure prompt response to facility intrusion alarms.\n\nWhile Washington state regulates and inspects clinical laboratories that do testing for human illness diagnosis, it does not regulate research, veterinary or forensic laboratories, Moyer said. The state also does not have a process for receiving notifications of lab-associated incidents or accidents. While labs are required to report incidents involving select agents to the Federal Select Agent Program, Washington state officials are not notified, Moyer said.", "photo": "", "photo_credit": "", "photo_file": "", "docs": "", "docs_file": "", "edited_status": "Unedited", "edited_by": "", "editing_notes": ""}, {"lab_id": "WI02", "name": "University of Wisconsin-Madison/ Influenza Research Institute", "city": "Madison", "state": "Wisconsin", "highest_bsl": "BSL 3", "byline": "Nick Penzenstadler", "description": "The University of Wisconsin-Madison has 58 laboratory spaces designed for BSL-3 and/or ABSL-3.
