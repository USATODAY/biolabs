Examples include West Nile virus transmitted by mosquitoes and MERS-Coronavirus in camels, Dodge said.  The labs are registered to work with select agents. \nIn October 2014, a safety worker at the university was bitten by a mosquito while in a laboratory adjoining an insectary where genetically modified mosquitoes were being used in a dengue virus experiment, according to an incident report the university filed with the National Institutes of Health. \u201cThe person did not find the mosquito, nor did others who searched the lab area for several hours, and over the period of 3 days,\u201d the report said, adding that it \u201cis unlikely that the mosquito which caused the bite was infected with any virus.\u201d The worker was tested for dengue virus antibodies after the bite and again three weeks later but showed no signs of exposure, the report said.\nIn May 2014, a worker in a BSL-3 lab failed to make sure specimens of Burkholderia pseudomallei had been killed before shipping samples \u2013 some still able to grow \u2013 to another lab where a worker handled them without key protective gear, according to an incident report to the NIH.

The BSO has tried to take on most of the burden for the Select Agent requirements; which is why another ABSO was hired. It was suggested by a committee member that CSU should band together with other universities to challenge the CDC in an effort to try to get them to relax these regulations.\u201d\nColorado State initially tried to charge $340 for copies of its Institutional Biosafety Committee minutes and related incident reports \u2013 and it blacked out the names of certain pathogens involved in research and mishaps. \n\u201cYou really think $340 is excessive? Yikes,\u201d Linda Schutjer, a senior legal counsel for the university, wrote in a Nov. 19, 2014, email after USA TODAY objected to the fee as excessive. Schutjer said it took the university 17 hours to gather and review the records, even though it is required under the NIH Guidelines to make them available to anyone who asks as a condition of its federal research funding. After a series of emails, the university waived the fees.\nBut when the university released the records, USA TODAY discovered blacked-out names of certain pathogens. The newspaper again filed a series of objections with the university, noting that Colorado State publicizes on its website that its scientists work with what appeared to be many of the redacted pathogens. \nThe university, in a Nov. 21, 2014, email, said it redacted names of select agents because of \u201csecurity concerns\u201d and that the decision to do this was based on consultation with \u201can expert\u201d at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Yet a spokesman for the CDC, Jason McDonald, told USA TODAY: \u201cWith the exception of specific security information (such as IT system passwords, key locations and lock combinations), the select agent regulations place no restrictions on the releasing [of] information related to select agents or toxins by regulated entities.\u201d \nAfter USA TODAY shared McDonald\u2019s statement with the university and said the newspaper would be filing a formal NIH Guidelines violation complaint, Schutjer on Dec. 4, 2014, released another set of records that restored names of the pathogens.\n", "photo": "CO04.jpg", "photo_credit": "V.

The facility includes BSL-3 facilities, records show, and has worked with such pathogens as avian influenza, West Nile virus and Newcastle disease.\nDuring separate incidents in June and September 2014, USDA staff working around select-agent strains of avian influenza in BSL-3 labs here were potentially exposed to the virus when they experienced equipment failures of air-purifying respirators, according to incident information obtained by USA TODAY under the Freedom of Information Act.\nIn the September incident, an animal caretaker noticed decreased airflow to their respirator and discovered a hose had separated from its coupling. The animal caretaker was put on antiviral medication for 10 days and told to monitor daily for development of a fever. No infection resulted, the records say. The manufacturer of the protective breathing gear replaced all the hoses at the lab, and lab officials required all hoses to have their joints reinforced with tape. \nIn June 2014, another employee experienced reduced airflow through an air-purifying respirator while taking samples from ducks involved in an avian influenza experiment. In that case, a tear was discovered in the breathing tube. All staff using BSL-3 facilities were retrained on proper assembly and inspection of personal protective equipment. In addition, the lab added a clear hose cover to the tubes for additional protection and latches on 50 poultry cages were replaced after the lab looked for possible snag hazards. The employee in this incident was told to monitor for development of a fever twice daily, plus take a 10-day course of antiviral medication. No infection resulted, the records say.\nIn another incident, around May 2014, scientists at the lab observed chickens unexpectedly becoming sick and dying in an experiment with a bird flu strain that shouldn\u2019t cause such serious illness. They discovered that what they thought was an H9N2 avian influenza specimen shipped to them by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta had been unknowingly cross-contaminated by the CDC with the deadly H5N1 strain, according to a CDC report of the incident.\n", "photo": "", "photo_credit": "", "photo_cutline": "", "docs": "Yes", "docs_file": "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1691870-ga02.html", "edited_status": "READY", "edited_by": "", "editing_notes": "Blurb, title edited"}, {"lab_id": "GA03", "name": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "city": "Atlanta", "state": "Georgia", "highest_bsl": "BSL-4", "byline": "Alison Young", "description": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has 50 U.S.-based labs that are registered for BSL-3 containment and 36 of them are in Atlanta, the agency said in response to questions from USA TODAY. The agency\u2019s Atlanta headquarters campus also has two suites of BSL-4 labs, the highest containment level, which works with the most dangerous pathogens, including the deadly Ebola virus.  The agency operates other BSL-3 labs in Fort Collins, Colo.; Anchorage, Alaska; and San Juan, Puerto Rico.\nThe CDC\u2019s labs in Atlanta were involved in several high-profile safety incidents during 2014, prompting a congressional hearing in July and sweeping promises of safety reforms from CDC Director Tom Frieden.  Changes have included procedural reviews, more training, installation of camera systems to better monitor safety protocols, and the hiring of a high-level official to oversee lab safety.\nIn December 2014, staff in CDC\u2019s elite Viral Special Pathogens Branch working in one of the agency\u2019s BSL-4 suites \u2013 where scientists use spacesuit-like, full-body protective gear with respirators filtering the air they breathe \u2013 confused two types of specimens of the deadly Ebola virus. Some samples contained live virus that were supposed to stay inside the BSL-4 lab. Others had undergone a kill step to make them safe to send to a BSL-2 lab, where staff generally wear simply gowns and gloves. But the wrong specimens were sent to the lower-level lab and a worker had to undergo 21 days of monitoring for potential Ebola infection but never became ill. \nThe CDC\u2019s investigation of the Ebola incident concluded that the specimens sent to the lower-level lab likely never contained any live virus because the samples were taken from animals in an experiment who appeared to have cleared the infection from their bodies. Although the CDC published a report of its internal investigation, the agency denied USA TODAY\u2019s request under the Freedom of Information Act for copies of the incident reports about the mistake, citing laws that exempt from release certain reports involving inspections or releases of potential bioterror pathogens deemed to be select agents. Ebola is listed as a select agent.\nIn June 2014, dozens of CDC employees were potentially exposed to anthrax after lab staff failed to make sure the spores had been killed before shipping them from a BSL-3 lab to BSL-2 lab that wasn\u2019t equipped to work with the live pathogen. The head of the CDC\u2019s bioterrorism response lab later resigned.\nIn early 2014, other CDC lab staff mistakenly cross-contaminated a mild strain of avian influenza with a deadly strain, then shipped the contaminated sample to a U.S. Department of Agriculture lab in Athens, Ga. USDA scientists in May 2014 discovered the CDC\u2019s mistake after birds in an experiment unexpectedly died. A CDC investigation concluded sloppy lab practices were to blame. \nUSA TODAY has reported for several years about other safety and security lapses at the CDC\u2019s Atlanta labs, including repeated problems with air-flow systems designed to keep infectious agents inside high-containment labs and failures to maintain proper security.  Typically private government audits of CDC labs, obtained by USA TODAY, found the agency\u2019s labs were cited in 2010 and 2009 for failures to provide biosafety training to many staff working in areas with pathogens that have the potential to be used as bioterror agents.\n", "photo": "GA03.jpg", "photo_credit": "Jessica McGowan, Getty Images", "photo_cutline": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta", "docs": "Yes", "docs_file": "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1691871-ga03.html", "edited_status": "READY", "edited_by": "", "editing_notes": "Blurb, title edited"}, {"lab_id": "GA04", "name": "Emory University, Yerkes National Primate Research Center", "city": "Atlanta", "state": "Georgia", "highest_bsl": "BSL-3", "byline": "Catherine Sheffo", "description": "The university\u2019s Atlanta campus has eight BSL-3 labs and four ABSL-3 labs, said Patty Olinger, the assistant vice president of the office of research administration.

Burns School of Medicine, according to the university\u2019s website. Recent research proposed for the university\u2019s BSL-3 labs has included work with West Nile virus, tuberculosis, hantaviruses, Japanese encephalitis virus and Burkholderia pseudomallei bacteria, the university\u2019s biosafety committee records show. As of early 2015, because of violations of Federal Select Agent Program regulations, the university\u2019s labs that work with potential bioterror pathogens were in a federal performance improvement program, according to records obtained by USA TODAY as part of an appeal of the university\u2019s denial of access to records about the sanctions. University officials declined to be interviewed or to answer questions about their high-containment labs. They also wouldn\u2019t discuss or release records relating to why select-agent regulators at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention placed their labs into the performance improvement program. \u201cThank you for the final opportunity to respond to your inquiries,\u201d wrote university spokeswoman Talia Ogliore in an April 14, 2015, email, \u201chowever, the University respectfully declines to provide additional information about our research program and approach.\u201d\nUSA TODAY has appealed the university\u2019s denial of access to correspondence and other records about regulatory actions taken against its labs. Hawaii\u2019s Office of Information Practices, which received the appeal in January 2015, said it could take a year or longer to make a decision in the case because it has a backlog of appeals.\nBut in correspondence the university sent to the office in response to USA TODAY\u2019s appeal, the university confirmed its labs had been placed in the select-agent performance improvement program. The university told the information practices agency that it\u2019s \u201cproud\u201d of the research it does \u201cand of entering voluntarily into a performance improvement plan to enhance our program even more. We do not believe entering into the program is an embarrassment, we think it should be showcased, but that would be improper because as participants in the Federal Select Agent Program, we are obligated to keep this information private,\u201d the university wrote to Hawaii\u2019s Office of Information Practices on Jan. 26, 2015. \u201cUH has been an exemplary participant in the Federal Select Agent Program.\u201d\nAccording to the CDC, significant and systemic safety or security violations \u2013 not exemplary performance \u2013 is what gets a lab a spot in the performance improvement program. While it is a voluntary choice for a lab to enter the program, in response to questions from USA TODAY the CDC said that the alternative would likely be suspension from the select-agent program \u2013 and halting of research \u2013 until problems are corrected.\nThe CDC would not comment on the University of Hawaii\u2019s case or what violations were identified at its labs by federal regulators. Since 2008, 33 lab operators that are registered to work with potential bioterror pathogens as part of the Federal Select Agent Program have been put into a performance improvement program, the CDC said. In a letter to Hawaii\u2019s information practices office, university Chancellor Robert Bley-Vroman said that keeping the disciplinary records secret is critical: \u201cWe believe that release of this information would present a danger to both national security and the health and welfare of residents of Hawaii.\u201d\nRecords show the information practices office asked the university whether it\u2019s possible to release any portions of the requested records with specific sensitive information redacted. Such redactions are a common practice under state and federal open records laws. The university said it\u2019s impossible to release anything because the \u201cmere fact that the University of Hawaii is participating in the Federal Select Agent Program\u201d must be kept secret. \u201cNone of the information sought is public, it is all information protected by bioterrorism laws.\u201d\nYet the university\u2019s website promotes the work its scientists are doing with pathogens that are select agents, such as Burkholderia pseudomallei, that require participation in the Federal Select Agent Program. \u201cWelcome to the Hoang Lab Website!\u201d says a webpage for Tung Hoang in the University of Hawaii-Manoa\u2019s microbiology department. The page says Hoang\u2019s research focuses on Burkholderia pseudomallei and notes the bacterium is \u201ca CDC category B and potential bioterrorism agent.\u201d A webpage for the university\u2019s department of tropical medicine and medical microbiology notes that key research areas include Burkholderia pseudomallei and Nipah virus, which also is a select agent. The university also uses its website to publicize journal articles \u2013 available for anyone to read \u2013 that its scientists have published about their research with select-agent pathogens. Although the university said it is prohibited from disclosing its participation in the Federal Select Agent Program, the CDC says that\u2019s not true.\n\u201cWith the exception of specific security information (such as IT system passwords, key locations and lock combinations), the select agent regulations place no restrictions on the releasing [of] information related to select agents or toxins by regulated entities,\u201d said Jason McDonald, a spokesman for the CDC, which co-runs the Federal Select Agent Program with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nAt the USDA, Freeda Isaac, director of Agriculture Select Agent Services, said in a statement: \u201cThe CDC and APHIS Federal Select Agent Program has not instructed entities to withhold select agent information from the public.\u201d\nA 2002 bioterrorism law prohibits certain named federal agencies from releasing specific information about select-agent labs\u2019 registration records. Yet in guidance to labs, the Federal Select Agent Program has emphasized they are allowed to publicize research with these bioterrorism pathogens. If this were not the case, universities and their scientists would routinely be violating bioterrorism laws each time they publish an article about select-agent research in a scientific journal.\n\u201cThe select agent regulations place no specific restrictions on the publication of research related to select agents or toxins,\u201d the Federal Select Agent Program says in guidance to labs posted on its website. \u201cHowever, any records or information systems that could allow an individual to gain access to the select agents or toxins should be safeguarded to prevent unauthorized access, theft, loss, or release of these materials.\u201d\nBley-Vroman, the university\u2019s chancellor, said USA TODAY is \u201cattempting to exploit a loophole\u201d by asking for records directly from the university, according to his January 2015 letter to the information practices office. But Courtney French, an attorney for USA TODAY, told the information office: \u201cThe University cannot withhold the information in one context while actively publicizing it in another.\u201d French noted that USA TODAY has never sought any sensitive security information.\nIn November 2014, a Hawaii television station reported it had obtained a copy of the CDC inspection report of the university\u2019s select-agent labs \u201cwhich said that UH officials did not conduct simple criminal background checks for some lab workers and didn\u2019t have a procedure to report suspicious or criminal acts to federal and local law enforcement.\u201d\nThe Hawaii News Now television report said that the CDC\u2019s inspection in May 2014 cited the labs for 30 violations and that the regulators\u2019 report said: \u201cThe CDC has significant concerns whether UH Manoa can possess and use select agents and toxins in a manner which protects public health and safety.\u201d\nThe university released to USA TODAY copies of its Institutional Biosafety Committee minutes and reports of incidents filed with the National Institutes of Health \u2013 as required as a condition of federal research funding. But in several places the university has redacted information that appears to involve its regulatory problems with the Federal Select Agent Program.\n", "photo": "HI01.jpg", "photo_credit": "The University of Hawaii", "photo_cutline": "The John A.

The purpose of the research is to better understand how the organisms cause disease and to develop vaccines and other tools to prevent disease as well as better tests for disease detection, the agency said. The center is registered to work with select agents.\nIn response to a Freedom of Information Act request seeking records of lab incidents at the center during 2013 and 2014, the USDA released a list with summary information on 10 incidents. All of those incidents happened in 2014. In June 2014, a lab worker was potentially exposed to Leptospira, a dangerous bacteria, because the person didn\u2019t follow safety procedures. The problems included including not wearing appropriate personal protective equipment and working with the pathogen on an open benchtop instead of inside a biosafety cabinet. Leptospira bacteria cause leptospirosis, a disease of humans and animals that if untreated can result in kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, respiratory problems and sometimes death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In nature, people get leptospirosis generally through contact with soil or water that has been contaminated by urine or body fluids from infected animals. According to the document, there was \u201cno injury\u201d associated with the incident and the employee was retrained on proper lab procedures.\nIn May 2014, an animal caretaker also was potentially exposed to leptospira when the person removed their face mask and rubbed an eye before washing their hands. The employee was retrained on proper procedures for removing protective equipment and exiting animal containment rooms, the document says. In September 2014, a veterinary medical officer was doing a postmortem examination on a cow with bovine tuberculosis when the person accidentally stabbed the side of their knee with a knife used in the exam. Mycobacterium bovis, the pathogen that causes bovine tuberculosis, can cause disease in humans, according to the CDC. \u201cIn people, M. bovis causes TB disease that can affect the lungs, lymph nodes, and other parts of the body,\u201d according to the CDC\u2019s fact sheet, which notes that not everyone infected with the pathogen gets sick. Fewer than 2% of the human TB cases in the United States are caused by M. bovis, the CDC says. The USDA\u2019s document doesn\u2019t say whether the vet was infected, and lists the nature of the injury from the incident only as \u201cPenetrating wound on medial side of knee.\u201d\nIn separate incidents, two employees were potentially exposed to Brucella abortus. Brucella bacteria can cause brucellosis in people when they have contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products, according to the CDC. Symptoms such as fever, sweats, fatigue and muscle or joint pain can occur from five days to five months after exposure. The disease can be treated with antibiotics and recovery from can take weeks to several months, the CDC says, depending on the severity of the disease, which can result in swelling of the heart, testicle and scrotum area and liver or spleen. In July 2014, an animal caretaker handled bags contaminated with blood from a Brucella-infected animal. \u201cEmployees in group were retrained on proper procedures,\u201d the record says. \u201cThe employee who handled the bags without gloves has not been allowed access to the animal containment building.\u201d In August 2014, a supervisory veterinary medical officer was stuck in the hand with a needle and potentially exposed to Brucella abortus, the document says.\n", "photo": "IA01.jpg", "photo_credit": "", "photo_cutline": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s National Animal Disease Center in Ames, Iowa", "docs": "Yes", "docs_file": "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1691883-ia01.html", "edited_status": "READY", "edited_by": "", "editing_notes": "Blurb, title edited"}, {"lab_id": "IA02", "name": "University of Iowa Laboratories", "city": "Iowa City", "state": "Iowa", "highest_bsl": "BSL-3", "byline": "Jason Clayworth", "description": "The University of Iowa refused to disclose the location, nature or number of the biological laboratories it oversees, citing an internal policy and Iowa law that it says allows it to keep the information secret for security-related reasons.

In response, the university told NIH that it discovered three incidents that were not reported to NIH but should have been, the records show.\nOne incident involved a study with transgenic mouse bone marrow stem cells that was performed between 2010 and 2014 without approval of the university\u2019s Institutional Biosafety Committee.

He declined to say what kinds of pathogens are studied in the labs. A USA TODAY investigation found that the LSU AgCenter is the unnamed university that lab regulators from the Federal Select Agent Program claimed in a June 2009 report to Congress had been fined $425,000 \u2013 which if true would be among the largest fines imposed in the program\u2019s history. Records obtained with state and federal open records requests show the fine was never imposed, even though federal investigators documented serious violations at LSU. Violations included the release of a dangerous bacterium from an LSU research facility that resulted in the infection of a cow in an adjacent disease-free herd; after the experiments, 27 cows infected with the bacteria were sent to an unapproved slaughter facility and their meat was sold commercially for human consumption. According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fact sheet on the bacterium, people are most at risk of exposure from consuming raw or unpasteurized dairy products, but the agency advises against eating undercooked meat.\nThe bacterium involved in the violations was Brucella abortus, which causes a contagious disease called brucellosis that can be economically devastating to the cattle industry. The disease, which is primarily a threat to cattle, bison, elk and deer, can cause pregnant animals to abort fetuses and result in reduced milk production, weight loss, infertility and lameness, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Brucella can also sicken people, causing fever, fatigue, muscle and joint pain and other symptoms that may last \u201cfor prolonged periods of time,\u201d according to the CDC. Brucella abortus and two other species of the bacterium are on the U.S. government\u2019s list of select agents because they pose a serious threat to agriculture and have the potential to be turned into bioweapons. In October 2007, during annual testing of LSU\u2019s herd of Crossbred/Brahman cattle, which had been certified as being Brucella-free, a 5-year-old cow branded with number \u201c1922\u201d tested positive for the infection, a USDA investigation report obtained under the federal Freedom of Information Act shows. Tests by the USDA\u2019s National Veterinary Services Laboratory would later confirm that the cow was infected with Brucella abortus and, specifically, that it was a subtype called \u201cbiovar 1 strain 2308\u201d \u2013the same strain used in LSU\u2019s research, according to the USDA\u2019s records and a report of the state agriculture department\u2019s investigation.\nThe Brahman herd was part of a breeding program at LSU\u2019s Ben Hur Farm that studies ways to improve beef cattle \u2013 and was not subject to any disease-related experiments. But the herd was kept in a 50-acre pasture adjacent to an LSU research facility. At the time the Brahman cow No. 1922 was infected, the research facility was doing experiments to test the effectiveness of a commercial Brucella vaccine by exposing cows in the project to the same Brucella abortus biovar 1 strain 2308, records show.\nThe 30-year-old facility where LSU did its Brucella research was open to the outdoors but included fencing and buffer zones to keep animals involved in experiments away from those in the adjacent Brahman herd. The LSU AgCenter, which says it halted its select-agent research after the incident was discovered, was building a high-security animal isolation facility at the time of the incident.\nBrucella bacteria are shed by infected animals in milk and in the aborted fetus, afterbirth and other reproductive tract discharges. Animals are infected through direct contact with infected animals, their fluids or discharges, as well as through contaminated water or feed. The disease cannot be cured and since 1934 federal and state vaccination and surveillance efforts have sought to eliminate the disease. Louisiana achieved brucellosis-free status in 2000, according to the state agriculture department.\nThe discovery of the Brucella-infected cow at LSU\u2019s Baton Rouge facility caused significant concern among state officials, who mobilized to stop a potential outbreak. They began tracing animals sold out of the LSU herd during the previous year, identifying all cattle herds within a mile of the LSU facility and creating plans to increase testing, records show.\nDespite investigations by LSU, the USDA, as well as state agriculture and wildlife officials, it was never determined how cow No. 1922 became exposed to the research strain of the bacterium. Henry Moreau, the Louisiana state veterinarian at the time, said: \u201cIt is my opinion that the release of this organism had to be by way of placental fluids or tissues. Direct contact between infected animals and what is now the quarantined herd is almost impossible. Waste water release, transmission by humans, and other less likely routes were also discounted,\u201d according to the Louisiana agriculture department\u2019s report on the incident. Recommendations were made, among other things, to put netting over pens housing infected animals to minimize the chance that infected tissue might be removed by large birds.\nWhile investigating the infected Brahman in the breeding herd, the USDA discovered that cattle exposed to and infected with Brucella abortus in the research program had repeatedly been sent to a slaughter plant in Plaquemine, La., that was not registered with the Federal Select Agent Program to accept experimental animals exposed to the highly regulated pathogen. \u201cThe resulting meat product from the slaughter of these animals was sold for human consumption,\u201d the USDA\u2019s investigation report says.\nThe people involved in slaughtering the experimental cows, because of their potential exposure to infectious fluids, were likely more at risk than those who ultimately ate meat from the animals, according to federal advice to hunters on protecting themselves against contracting brucellosis from wild hogs, bison, elk and caribou, which can also carry the disease. The advice on CDC\u2019s website instructs hunters to take precautions while butchering and to \u201cthoroughly cook meat from any animal that can get brucellosis.\u201d\nIn July 2008, the USDA notified LSU that the federal investigation had found the university violated select-agent regulations by transferring cattle infected with Brucella abortus to the slaughter plant and by failing to have biosafety procedures that could contain the bacteria, \u201ccausing infection of\u201d the Brahman cow. The letter, signed by the chief of enforcement operations, told LSU it could settle the matter by paying a $425,000 penalty.\nThe fine came as a surprise to the university, said Phil Elzer, the scientist running the Brucella research when the incident happened and who now is an associate vice chancellor at the LSU AgCenter. \u201cWe went back to them and basically said: We had no release, no one proved a release, no one proved it was our strain. We challenged them,\u201d Elzer said in an interview with USA TODAY. Elzer said LSU had for years routinely sent to slaughter the program\u2019s research cattle, which were tagged as being \u201csuspect\u201d or having brucellosis. This practice was declared in the research program\u2019s operating procedures that were reviewed and signed off on at each inspection by Federal Select Agent Program regulators, he said. \u201cTo all of a sudden say we were doing it wrong was very surprising,\u201d Elzer said.\nIn August 2008, LSU\u2019s Durham sent a letter to USDA asking for a hearing and offering to meet to discuss \u201cthe apparent misinformation/erroneous conclusions upon which the alleged violations and proposed penalty are based.\u201d In an interview with USA TODAY, Durham said: \u201cFrom our standpoint, we tried to do everything right.\u201d\nIn initial written statements to USA TODAY and in interviews, Elzer and Durham indicated that federal and state investigators never concluded the university\u2019s experiments were at fault. \u201cThe incident was not found to be caused by a violation of federal regulations; no fines were imposed upon LSU, and the regulatory agencies had uncertainty as to whether the strain of bacteria in the affected cow was the same strain that was being used in the LSU research,\u201d they said in a November 2014 email to USA TODAY before granting an interview a few days later.\nYet, in early December 2014, when USA TODAY received copies of the USDA and Louisiana agriculture departments\u2019 investigative reports in response to public records requests, the documents showed no uncertainty. An LSU spokeswoman sent an email clarifying that the \u201cuncertainty\u201d expressed by Elzer involved a USDA test result showing the bacteria in the infected animal didn\u2019t produce a substance called H2S, \u201cwhile the lab organism being used in Dr. Elzer\u2019s research did produce H2S.\u201d This distinction is not flagged or discussed in the released federal or state records as raising any concerns about a bacteria mismatch.\nIt\u2019s unclear, based on records obtained by USA TODAY, what happened in the months that followed LSU\u2019s request for a hearing. But in January 2010, the USDA sent a letter to LSU saying the case was being closed. Though the letter reiterated information about the potential release of Brucella abortus and the transfer of infected cattle to an unregistered slaughter plant, there is no mention of any fine or that a fine had been dropped. The letter reminded the university of its obligation to have sufficient biosafety and containment procedures and that transfers of select agents must be authorized by a federal official. Elzer said the fine was eventually withdrawn by the USDA. Why the fine was dropped is unknown. The USDA\u2019s enforcement tracking system includes only this note: \u201c$425,000 HAS BEEN RESCINDED PER THE PROGRAM.\u201d\nIn its annual report to Congress about thefts, losses or releases of select agents during 2008, the Federal Select Agent Program \u2013 which is jointly run by the CDC and USDA \u2013 provided aggregated counts of incidents by type but did not name any labs that had issues. The report noted there were two \u201cvalidated reports of a release of a select agent\u201d and that one release was identified during routine brucellosis testing when a \u201ccow in an adjacent brucellosis-free herd at a facility with ongoing brucellosis research tested positive for brucellosis and was destroyed. The report was referred to IES for apparent non-compliance with the Select Agent Regulations and resulted in USDA and HHS suspending the entity\u2019s research. In addition, IES imposed a civil money penalty of $425,000.\u201d The report to Congress was dated June 2009 \u2013 10 months after LSU had asked for a hearing to appeal the fine.\nUSDA officials declined requests for interviews about the LSU incident, why Congress was told the fine had been imposed when it wasn\u2019t and why none of the later reports to Congress sought to correct the enforcement record. In a written statement, Freeda Isaac, the USDA\u2019s director of Agriculture Select Agent Services, said the 2008 report \u201cshould have stated that we were proposing a fine, instead of stating we issued a fine. In the end, there was no fine.\u201d Isaac added in November 2014: \u201cIn response to the Brucella release listed in the report, [USDA] did suspend a portion of the registration at LSU related to that release and required the entity to address the issues related to that release. That portion of the registration is still suspended.\u201d\nThe LSU AgCenter no longer conducts experiments with select agent strains of Brucella, Elzer said \u2013 not even in the new facility that a press release from 2012 says had been built with his vaccine work in mind. As the facility was nearing completion, Elzer said that federal requirements for labs working with Brucella changed and would have required \u201ca couple million dollars\u201d worth of modifications to the building, \u201cso we decided not to do select agent work there.\u201d\nNone of the details about this serious lab safety incident or how federal lab regulators failed to impose the fine would be public if not for months of investigation by USA TODAY. Although LSU officials eventually granted interviews in November 2014 and released a copy of their internal investigation report and some related regulatory records in December 2014, the university initially denied USA TODAY\u2019s August 2014 open records request. LSU also denied repeated appeals by a reporter and an attorney for the newspaper saying the records must be released. An attorney for LSU, Thomas Peak, had argued that federal bioterrorism regulations prohibited release of records about the incident and later said that the university\u2019s records of the incident didn\u2019t meet the definition of public records because they were generated because of the Federal Select Agent Program. LSU spokesman Ernie Ballard said university staff couldn\u2019t discuss the case in an interview \u201cwithout CDC permission.\u201d Yet officials at the CDC and USDA told USA TODAY there were no prohibitions against select-agent labs discussing their research or disciplinary cases. After USA TODAY told university officials that the newspaper had obtained records in December from the USDA and Louisiana\u2019s agriculture department detailing their investigations\u2019 findings, LSU released its records.\n", "photo": "LA01.jpg", "photo_credit": "LSU 2008 incident investigation report", "photo_cutline": "The LSU AgCenter\u2019s brucellosis research facility, as it looked in 2008 at the time of the brucella release incident.", "docs": "Yes", "docs_file": "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1691896-la01.html", "edited_status": "READY", "edited_by": "", "editing_notes": "Blurb, title edited"}, {"lab_id": "LA02", "name": "Tulane National Primate Research Center", "city": "Covington", "state": "Louisiana", "highest_bsl": "BSL-3", "byline": "Alison Young and John Hillkirk", "description": "The Tulane National Primate Research Center has two BSL-3 labs in Covington, La., approximately 40 miles from the university\u2019s main campus in New Orleans, and the university plans to add a third at its downtown health science center. None of the BSL-3 labs is on the main campus. Michael Strecker, the university\u2019s executive director of public relations, said the focus of the BSL-3 work is developing vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics for a variety of infectious agents, including tuberculosis, Burkholderia, ricin toxin and chikungunya virus.\nThe primate center became the focus of federal and state investigations in December 2014 after tests showed two rhesus macaque monkeys \u2013 which were not part of any experiments \u2013 were sickened by a strain of bioterror bacteria being studied in a BSL-3 lab elsewhere on the 500-acre campus. Later tests showed additional monkeys had been exposed.\nThe lab incident is of particular concern because some monkeys exposed to the bacteria were kept in a huge, outdoor breeding colony on the facility\u2019s South Campus. \nThe bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, lives and grows in soil and water and is primarily found in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is not found in the United States. Louisiana state officials have expressed concern that the lab accident may have resulted in the environment around the primate center becoming contaminated with the bacteria. Tulane officials have said they do not believe the bacteria had gotten out of their buildings.\nThe bacteria can cause a potentially serious disease called melioidosis in people and animals. It has a wide range of symptoms, from fever to localized skin infections to deadly pneumonias. Contact with contaminated soil or water is the main route of exposure. Most of those exposed will not show any symptoms. But the bacteria can hide for years in the body, CDC officials said. In countries where the bacterium is endemic, the fatality rate for patients with melioidosis can be up to 50%. And even with the best medical care, infections can be difficult to treat and involve long courses of antibiotics, CDC officials said.\nThe bacterium has been studied in other countries as a possible bioweapon; Tulane said its research involved work to develop a potential vaccine. (Full coverage of the incident is available at: biolabs.usatoday.com.) As a result of the release of the bacteria, federal regulators ordered Tulane\u2019s primate center to halt all research involving select agents until the cause of the accident was identified and corrections were made. Andrew Lackner, primate center director, said about 10 projects involving a variety of select agents were affected by the order. Sloppy biosafety practices and contaminated worker clothing are the likely ways the bacteria got out of Tulane\u2019s lab, according to findings by federal investigators released in March 2015.\nThe CDC last inspected Tulane\u2019s select-agent labs in December 2013. No significant problems were cited. The primate center had never been suspended or subjected to regulatory enforcement actions before, the agency said.\nAccording to Tulane\u2019s biosafety committee minutes, the committee approved a research project involving Burkholderia at its July 25, 2014, meeting. Although the specific type of the bacteria was redacted by the university, in the minutes a researcher heading the project lists Burkholderia pseudomallei as one of her research interests on Tulane\u2019s website. It is unclear whether this is the same research that was involved in the bacteria release incident.\n", "photo": "LA02.jpg", "photo_credit": "Tulane National Primate Research Center", "photo_cutline": "Tulane National Primate Research Center", "docs": "Yes", "docs_file": "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1691897-la02.html", "edited_status": "READY", "edited_by": "", "editing_notes": "Blurb, title edited"}, {"lab_id": "LA03", "name": "LSU Health Sciences Center Shreveport", "city": "Shreveport", "state": "Louisiana", "highest_bsl": "BSL-3", "byline": "Catherine Sheffo", "description": "The university\u2019s Shreveport campus is home to an ABSL-3 suite with two laboratories and two animal care rooms, said Matthew Woolard, an assistant microbiology and immunology professor.

The incident on Dec. 29, 2014, involved the potential exposures of two laboratory workers to specimens of a weakened strain of Yersinia pestis, a bacterium that causes plague, which was being dried for a suspicious-powders study.\nOne exposure occurred when a lab manager, with a bare hand that had cuts on it, ran a finger across a machine\u2019s lid while examining a slimy substance that was thought to be innocuous.

The reports include multiple incidents of holes developing in spacesuit-like full-body protective gear used when working with deadly pathogens in BSL-4 labs, a potentially missing vial of a bioterror pathogen and an exploding freezer bag of specimens. \nOn July 25, 2014, while wearing a suit and taking a chemical shower before leaving a BSL-4 lab, the scrubs the employee was wearing under the protective suit became wet on the back of one leg \u201cwhere a previous patch had been installed,\u201d the report says. Lab officials determined that no potential exposure occurred. The report doesn\u2019t say what pathogen had been worked with in the lab. \u201cThe suit was retired,\u201d the report says. On Sept. 24 and 29, 2014, workers\u2019 suits developed holes that they discovered when the suits leaked while showering out of BSL-4 labs. One suit developed a hole in the shoulder area and the other suit had a zipper that was worn and leaking. In both cases the report sites \u201cDesign issues\u201d as the root cause. On Oct. 2, 2014, a worker noticed their suit leaking through the top of their visor while in the shower. Two more suits were reported with holes on Oct. 30, 2014. Three more suits with holes were reported in January 2015.\nIn July 2014, research staff discovered a missing vial of an undisclosed select agent, the government\u2019s term for pathogens with potential to be used as bioweapons. Lab staff said they think the content of the vial may have been added to others from the same shipment, the report says. Also in July 2014, a worker reported that while opening a minus-80-degree-Celsius freezer in the BSL-4 lab, \u201ca plastic ziplock bag that was expanded to capacity spontaneously burst discharging the contents towards the head of my BSL-4 suit. 4 2ml cryovial tubes were discharged from the rupture in the ziplock bag towards my person and onto the floor.\u201d\nMeanwhile, an  October 2014 report said an \u201cemployee noticed a stink bug while in the BSL-3 shower of the second floor. The stink bug never left containment. Health and Safety discarded the stink bug within containment. The area was also surface decontaminated.

It also investigates disease outbreaks and other threats to public health. The organization has been a key Defense Department laboratory since 1969. USAMRIID says its research has included work with Ebola and Marburg viruses, as well as anthrax, plague, hantavirus, botulism, ricin toxin and staphylococcal enterotoxin B. USAMRIID\u2019s facilities include labs that operate at BSL-3, as well as some that operate at BSL-4, the highest containment level used for the world\u2019s most deadly pathogens. Viruses such as Ebola are worked with in BSL-4 labs. Staff working in the BSL-4 labs at USAMRIID wear \u201cfully encapsulating positive-pressure suits\u201d \u2013 which are often referred to as spacesuits \u2013 and breathe HEPA-filtered air. Before leaving a BSL-4 lab, a worker must take a liquid disinfectant shower and a personal shower, the lab said in a statement.\nIn response to a Freedom of Information Act request from USA TODAY, USAMRIID released nearly 300 pages of reports of incidents that occurred in its labs during 2012, 2013 and 2014. The Army has blacked out significant portions of the records. The records show at least 37 incidents of holes or tears developing in personal protective equipment over a 20-month period in 2013 and 2014. Some reports indicate defective protective suits, others indicate the suits were old or worn out. A lab worker who was performing an autopsy on an animal reported a small split in a seam of a suit in March 2013. The nature of the exposure was redacted from the report. The cause: \u201cApparent repetitive use defect in 9-year old suit that split due to repeated bending/folding resulting in material failure.\u201d\nIn December 2013, while exiting the chemical shower, a researcher discovered that a previously repaired hole in their suit\u2019s left foot had broken open again. In January 2014, a seam separated on the heel of a contractor\u2019s blue BSL-4 suit. In February 2014, another worker found a hole in the foot of their blue safety suit while showering out and the report notes: \u201cSmall holes in the feet of the Blue suits is a relatively common event. This is a known weakness/flaw in these suits.\u201d On a single day in May 2014, a scientist noticed that their leg got wet while showering out of the lab and the report cites defective equipment; and another worker reported finding a hole in their visor while showering out. In July 2014, three incidents involved holes or tears; two specified they were in the feet of their suits.\nThe reports note incidents involving problems with biosafety cabinets, which are special, enclosed spaces that help contain pathogens when scientists work with them.\nAccording to a June 26, 2013, incident report, a laboratory technician reported that \u201cpower outage caused biosafety cabinet to fail.\u201d The agents were in culture plates with lids, the report says. \u201cBSC was not on backup power; continuing safety issue for institute. \u2026 Anticipate [redacted] will provide backup power to all BSCs.\u201d On June 14, 2013, a microbiologist reported that a biosafety cabinet \u201cfailed while individual was counting [redacted] colonies on plates (closed with lid).\u201d The nature of the exposure was redacted but the report says, \u201cThe cause was defective equipment.\u201d Officials with USAMRIID declined to be interviewed. In a written statement, the lab officials said that the spacesuit-like protective gear worn by scientists in BSL-4 labs \u201care replaced continuously\u201d based on testing by those in the BSL-4 suite or the organization\u2019s safety division. All incidents with gloves and suits are tracked and investigated \u201cregardless of the level of risk\u201d to make sure no trend is developing and the information is provided to manufacturers, the lab said.\nAll positive-pressure encapsulating suits used inside the USAMRIID BSL-4 suites are thoroughly tested and inspected before they are initially issued, and by laboratory personnel prior to each entry, the lab said.\nUSAMRIID also said that even with a tear, the air pressure in the suit would keep pathogens from entering: \u201cThe suits are supplied by a dedicated air system that is HEPA filtered prior to reaching the suit. The supplied air protects the individuals wearing the positive pressure encapsulating suits by functioning both as their source of breathing air and as a secondary protective envelope in case of a suit or outer glove tear. The suits are positively pressurized, and the laboratory suites are operating under continuous negative airflow, so any hole or tear in a suit results in the air blowing away from the individual wearing it.\nThe life span of the suits varies depending on who wears it, the type of work they do and how often they go into the BSL-4 suites, USAMRIID said, adding: \u201cThat is why some suits have lasted significantly longer than others before needing to be removed from active service.\u201d If a biosafety cabinet loses power, USAMRIID said, staff are trained to \u201cslowly remove their hands from the unit so as not to disturb the \u2018curtain of airflow,\u2019 \u201d then to close the unit and report the incident. Although USAMRIID said it has emergency power for critical systems, not all biosafety cabinets have emergency backup power. USAMRIID, in its statement, emphasized that it \u201chas decades of experience operating containment laboratories. Our primary objective is to provide a safe and secure environment for our workforce and the surrounding communities.\u201d\nIn 2009, a military scientist at USAMRIID was diagnosed with tularemia, a disease caused by a bacteria considered to pose a potential bioterror threat. The scientist was treated with antibiotics, according to information USAMRIID released at the time.\nIn 2004, a USAMRIID scientist working in a BSL-4 lab was potentially exposed to a strain of Ebola virus while trying to inject a mouse infected two days earlier, according to an account published by USAMRIID scientists in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. The mouse \u201ckicked the syringe, causing the needle to pierce the person\u2019s left hand gloves, resulting in a small laceration,\u201d the report says. The scientist was quarantined in a special isolation treatment facility at USAMRIID referred to as \u201cthe slammer.\u201d The patient never became ill and was discharged after 21 days.\nIn spring 2000, a microbiologist from USAMRIID became the first human case of a disease called glanders in the United States since 1945, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the infection. The microbiologist worked with several types of bacteria, including Burkholderia mallei, the pathogen that causes glanders. The scientist\u2019s symptoms worsened over about six weeks and he eventually became so ill he was put on a mechanical ventilator. Tests eventually identified Burkholderia mallei in fluid from a liver abscess, and after the patient was given antibiotics that the strain was sensitive to, his symptoms rapidly improved. The CDC noted that \u201cthe patient did not recall an unusual incident while working with B. mallei. \u2026 Most laboratory-acquired infections are associated with routine handling of microbes and not with injuries.\u201d\nAccording to the FBI, the source of the 2001 anthrax letter attacks in the United States that killed five and sickened 17 was USAMRIID biologist Bruce Ivins. In 2008, as charges were about to be filed, Ivins took a fatal overdose of Tylenol. The FBI\u2019s investigation, however, has been questioned over the years, including reports by the National Academy of Sciences and the Government Accountability Office that questioned the scientific testing used to link the mailed anthrax spores to Ivins\u2019 lab.\n", "photo": "MD11.jpg", "photo_credit": "H.

It also has four BSL-4 lab suites, plus related animal support areas, the lab said in response to USA TODAY\u2019s questions.\nBSL-4, where scientists wear full-body, spacesuit-like protective gear, is the highest level of laboratory containment and is used to work with the most dangerous pathogens for which there are no vaccines or treatments. As of April 2015, almost all of the BSL-4 lab space was focused on research with the deadly Ebola virus because of the outbreak in West Africa, the lab said in an emailed statement. \u201cAdditional projects under way in the level-3 and level-4 laboratories involve MERS, Lassa, Nipah, Hendra, hanta, dengue, West Nile, tick-borne encephalitis and other viruses; and the agents that cause tularemia, plague, Q fever and other bacterial diseases,\u201d the lab said. In most cases, the research uses animal models of disease to develop diagnostic tests, treatments and vaccines.\nIn May 2014, scientists inside one of Rocky Mountain Laboratories\u2019 BSL-4 labs spent hours \u2013 while wearing their bulky spacesuit-like protective gear \u2013 searching for a mouse that had escaped inside the lab, according to an incident report. The mouse had been infected 21 days earlier with a strain of Lassa virus, which causes a type of hemorrhagic fever with symptoms similar to Ebola. The mouse was found and captured the next morning, the records say, and \u201cwas disposed of.\u201d USA TODAY reported on this incident in September 2014. In August 2014, other records show, an employee in a BSL-3 lab had a HEPA filter fall out of their air-purifying respirator while doing work with Oropouche virus inside a biosafety cabinet. Oropouche virus causes Oropouche fever, a disease found in South America. \u201cWhile the PAPR [powered air-purifying respirator] was compromised, no agent was present in the laboratory outside of primary containment at the time of the incident. The results of smoke testing indicated that a loose HEPA housing would compromise the ability of the PAPR to protect the user from aerosols. In addition, smoke testing indicated that, even under the worst conditions (2 people using vigorous arm movements and crossing arms extensively), smoke (aerosol simulant) was not released from the cabinet. Therefore, even if the HEPA filter had been loose for an unknown period of time, the BSC [biosafety cabinet] and lab air handling system were functioning properly. Taken together, the results indicate that the compromised PAPR would not have resulted in the individual being exposed to infectious aerosols.\u201d But, \u201cout of an abundance of caution,\u201d the employee was referred to occupational medical staff.\nIn February 2014, a worker in a BSL-2 lab was bitten on the thumb by a mouse infected with both a wild-type strain of Borrelia burgdorferi and a recombinant strain of Borrelia burgdorferi, according to an incident report the lab filed with the NIH. The bacterium causes Lyme disease. The employee did not show any signs of infection, the report says.\nRocky Mountain Laboratories\u2019 history dates back more than 100 years, when scientists came to this area of Montana to investigate a disease locals called \u201cblack measles\u201d that was sickening and killing settlers.

Researchers have worked with pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Avery said. \nThe BSL-3 research is directed broadly at developing drugs, diagnostics and vaccines to protect humans from infectious disease. Duke\u2019s RBL is registered to work with select agents. Recent research with Yersinia pestis involved testing the ability of some novel compounds to kill the bacterium in the test tube, which could lead to developing antibiotics. Recent research with Mycobacterium tuberculosis involved identification of the human antibody response to the surface of the bacterium. A future tuberculosis vaccine may produce these antibodies as a mechanism of protection from tuberculosis infection.\nIn March 2012, a research worker grazed a needle that was being used to inject multiple zebrafish embryos with wild\u2010type Mycobacterium marinum, a genetically modified organism, according to documents provided by Richard Frothingham, co-chair of the Duke Institutional Biosafety Committee. The worker did not consider the injury significant and did not report the event at that time. About a week later, the worker noted a small nodule on the index finger of her right hand and reported this to her supervisor. Providers at Duke\u2019s Employee Occupational Health and Wellness (EOHW) office concluded that this likely represented an M. marinum infection and initiated therapy with azithromycin and ethambutol. The worker completed a six-week course of therapy without side effects and was last assessed at EOHW on May 7, 2012, and had no tenderness or loss of function. In June 2012, the biosafety committee minutes from Duke noted that a lab researcher experienced a cut with dissection scissors used to cut up brain tissue from a mouse that had been transfected 12 weeks earlier with a recombinant avian retrovirus. The safety committee reviewed the incident and noted that corrective action was taken.\nIn May 2014, Duke reported that an employee, while working off-site in a Maryland lab, was exposed to a vector being developed as a potential HIV vaccine described as replication\u2010deficient, integrase\u2010defective, VSV\u2010G pseudotyped lentiviral vector expressing HIV Env.

The center is registered to work with select agents that affect animals, and it maintains a livestock vaccine bank, he said. \nThe diseases studied at the center do not affect people, but could be devastating to livestock herds and, as a result, the food supply and the economy, said DHS in a statement. Much of the center\u2019s research has focused on foot-and-mouth disease, considered one of the most economically devastating livestock diseases in the world. The disease was eradicated in the United States in 1929, but still exists in Africa, South America and Asia, according to the USDA.\nFoot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious virus that infects animals with cloven or divided hooves, such as cows, pigs, sheep, goats and deer. Infected animals have fever and painful blisters on their tongues, lips and inside their mouths, as well as around their hooves and mammary glands. Although most of these animals won\u2019t die from the disease, they suffer from lameness and stop eating, leaving them weakened and affecting their ability to produce milk and meat, according to the USDA. The virus is spread through body excretions and even by an infected animal\u2019s breath, and it can survive on contaminated soil or other materials for months. \nDocuments obtained by USA TODAY under the federal Freedom of Information Act show nine incidents at Plum Island\u2019s labs during 2013 and 2014. \nIn April 2013, a plate containing Foot-and-mouth-disease virus caught on a scientist\u2019s sleeve and fell to the floor. The plate \u201clanded right side up with the lid slightly ajar. The majority of the media (EMEM, virus dilution, and cells) were still in the plate,\u201d the report says. Paper towels containing a bleach solution were placed on top of the spill for a minimum of 20 minutes, then autoclaved. The 1-foot area where the spill occurred was then bleached again. The report notes that the virus is not infectious to humans and that the spill was contained within the enhanced BSL-3 lab space.\nIn February 2013, a student in the center\u2019s foreign animal disease diagnostic course was \u201cnipped\u201d by a pig that appears, based on the redacted records, to have been involved in an African swine fever study. African swine fever virus causes a hemorrhagic disease in pigs that has a high death rate. The student was wearing a protective Tyvek suit and reported her skin being \u201cpinched\u201d and finding a \u201cscant amount of blood\u201d on the inside of the suit.

Battelle does biomedical research for government, industry and academia.\nIn West Jefferson, Battelle does effectiveness and safety testing of vaccines and other compounds to prevent or treat infectious diseases and biological threats. Pathogens used in research at the facility include influenza and anthrax, and the labs are registered to work with select agents, the organization said.\nAs a private organization, Battelle is not directly subject to state or federal open records laws that would require it to release copies of lab accident reports. It also has organized its internal biosafety oversight committees in a way that shields much of its research from public review.\nInstead of having a single biosafety committee to oversee research, Battelle has set up two. One committee reviews research involving just recombinant DNA experiments that involve genetically manipulated organisms. Such research represents a subset of the work done at the facility. The minutes of this Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), as a condition of federal research funding, are subject to public transparency requirements of the NIH Guidelines. Battelle released these IBC minutes to USA TODAY, but they don\u2019t contain any information about BSL-3 research.\nBattelle says that\u2019s because none of the work done in the BSL-3 labs involved recombinant DNA research during 2013 and 2014, the period covered by USA TODAY\u2019s request. The NIH Guidelines focus on requirements for conducting recombinant DNA research and transparency about that research.\nBattelle has set up a separate biosafety committee that oversees all research that doesn\u2019t involve recombinant DNA experiments. That\u2019s the committee that oversaw all of the BSL-3 work in West Jefferson during 2013 and 2014. Battelle declined to release minutes from this committee.\n\u201cLike other entities and companies, we are bound by contractual obligations, non-disclosure agreements and national security guidelines to protect certain information. Due to these obligations, the minutes are not publicly available,\u201d Battelle said in a statement.\nBattelle said it had no NIH-reportable incidents involving recombinant DNA experiments during the three-year period, from 2012 through 2014, covered in USA TODAY\u2019s document request.\nIn response to questions about lab incidents involving other types of research, Battelle said: \u201cDuring 2013 and 2014, Battelle reported fewer than a dozen select-agent-related incidents to the CDC. Most of these incidents involved laboratory container breakage, working material labeling errors, or needlesticks. None resulted in a laboratory-acquired infection.\u201d\nUSA TODAY was unable to get the incident reports Battelle filed with CDC. The CDC denied other requests by USA TODAY under the federal Freedom of Information Act for select-agent incident reports citing language that Congress put in the Public Health Preparedness and Bioterrorism Act of 2002. It says that certain specified federal agencies, including CDC, shall not disclose \u201cany notification of a release of a listed agent or toxin submitted under subsections (b) and (c) of this section, or any notification of theft or loss submitted under such subsections.\u201d\nBattelle said its labs address problems when incidents happen.\n\u201cBattelle\u2019s research operations are highly regulated and inspected by various government agencies and accrediting institutions. As part of our lab operations, if an event occurs (including \u2018near miss\u2019 events), an investigation is conducted which focuses on the incident\u2019s cause and identification of possible corrective actions to eliminate or reduce the potential for recurrence,\u201d the organization said in its statement to USA TODAY.\nBattelle, also called the Battelle Memorial Institute, was founded in 1929 and is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. It has more than 22,000 employees at more than 60 locations around the world. Its many activities include providing scientific and administrative services to support research at the NIAID Integrated Research Facility, another high-containment laboratory operated by the National Institutes of Health in Fort Detrick, Md. \nIn its fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2013, Battelle had nearly $4.8 billion in revenue, according to its most recent IRS non-profit tax return posted at Guidestar.org.\n", "photo": "", "photo_credit": "", "photo_cutline": "", "docs": "Yes", "docs_file": "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2069302-oh08.html", "edited_status": "READY", "edited_by": "", "editing_notes": "Blurb, title edited"}, {"lab_id": "OH11", "name": "Wright-Patterson AFB", "city": "Dayton", "state": "Ohio", "highest_bsl": "BSL-3", "byline": "Nick Penzenstadler", "description": "Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, operates one BSL-3 laboratory and is constructing a second one, wrote Laura McGowan, a base spokeswoman.

Scientists do research on influenza and focus on pandemic strains that could pose a global health threat. The labs work with avian influenza and velogenic Newcastle disease virus.\nIn May 2014, a worker in an enhanced BSL-3 lab discovered that five ferrets had escaped their cage. The ferrets had been inoculated a week earlier with the deadly H7N9 avian influenza virus but didn\u2019t show symptoms, according to a report of the incident. This strain of bird flu, first identified in 2013, has caused severe respiratory illness in people and about one-third of those sickened have died. As the worker put the ferrets back in their cage, she discovered a tear in her double gloves and a small cut on a finger. The worker\u2019s risk of infection was deemed \u201cvery low,\u201d and blood tests showed no signs of infection. According to the report, the research was overseen by Richard Webby.\nIn June 2014, St. Jude\u2019s biosafety committee approved a new project proposed by Webby to do a controversial type of research that the minutes say has the \u201chigh likelihood of conferring enhancements\u201d \u2013 in other words, making more dangerous \u2013 strains of avian influenza virus that have a low ability to produce disease.

In addition, a building under construction will include a third BSL-3 lab for use by the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, he said.\nThe university declined to grant an interview about the type of research it does in its BSL-3 labs, its approach to biosafety or the incidents its labs have reported in recent years. \u201cRegarding other aspects of your inquiry, we think the information provided in response to your earlier FOI request is sufficient,\u201d Stephenson said in an email.\nIn 2007, Texas A&M became the first select-agent laboratory to be ordered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to halt work with select agents in the wake of inspectors finding serious biosafety issues and the university\u2019s failure to report incidents, according to testimony to Congress that year by the Government Accountability Office. The issues were discovered after the Sunshine Project, a non-profit watchdog group, revealed that a lab worker was exposed to Brucella bacteria, a potential bioterror agent, while cleaning an aerosol chamber after an experiment and later became ill. \u201cBut no report was subsequently made to the CDC as required by federal regulation and a year passed before \u2026 [the Sunshine Project] uncovered the lapse in reporting and forced TAMU to notify the CDC,\u201d the GAO reported in 2007. When the CDC investigated, it found numerous violations, including that the university wasn\u2019t authorized to aerosolize Brucella and that multiple workers from a different BSL-3 lab had tested positive for antigens to Coxiella, another select agent that causes Q fever \u2013 but those potential exposures had never been reported to regulators, the GAO said.\nRecords obtained by USA TODAY show Texas A&M has regularly reported incidents in recent years, even promptly contacting NIH officials to alert them of mishaps that may not require reports.\nAs required under the transparency requirements of the NIH Guidelines as a condition of its federal research funding, Texas A&M University released copies of its Institutional Biosafety Committee minutes for 2013 and 2014, plus reports of incidents involving recombinant DNA experiments during 2012, 2013 and 2014.The documents include reports sent by Texas A&M to officials at the NIH about two dozen incidents involving potential exposures, animal bites, needle sticks, equipment failures and experiments that were conducted without proper approvals in labs of all biosafety levels. Not all types of lab incidents have to be reported to the NIH \u2013 only those involving certain research with genetically modified organisms, and therefore the released reports reflect only incidents from a subset of the university\u2019s research. In 2013, the reports show, Texas A&M\u2019s BSL-3 suites had repeated issues with power failures that resulted in the labs losing negative air pressure, a key biosafety feature that is among several used to keep pathogens contained inside the lab. On May 6, 2013, a brief commercial power outage or voltage drop caused the BSL-3\u2019s HVAC air-handling system to shut down around 10 p.m. Because of the short duration of the anomaly, power didn\u2019t transfer to the backup generator, the university\u2019s biosafety officer told the NIH. During the three to four minutes it took to restore full HVAC systems, \u201cthe BL3 suite did become positively pressurized with respect to the adjacent space,\u201d the biosafety officer said. No work with any infectious materials were taking place during the outage, the university said, adding that staff was investigating the root cause of the incident.\nOn May 10, 2013, the university\u2019s biosafety officer told the NIH that after another bad storm the previous night, the BSL-3 lab again experienced a brief power outage. \u201cThe engineers were able to reset the BSL-3 within seconds of it going off line, but a couple of rooms in the suite went briefly positive. I do not know whether this brief outage resulted in a true reversal of airflow or loss of containment. No one was working in the lab at the time,\u201d the biosafety officer wrote, detailing a variety of actions the university was taking. \u201cEffective immediately, operations in the BL3 lab have ceased,\u201d the biosafety officer wrote, adding that the lab would be decontaminated with vaporized hydrogen peroxide and that numerous tests and engineering fixes were planned.\nOn May 31, 2013, the biosafety officer sent an email to the NIH saying building engineers had fixed the issues and the BSL-3 lab had been reopened. \u201cWe are confident that power outages will not be a problem in this lab,\u201d the email said, but noted that, as a precaution, the lab had instituted a plan at the time to not conduct research in the BSL-3 suite during significant weather events.\nOn Nov. 1, 2013, the biosafety officer reported another airflow failure in one of the university\u2019s active BSL-3 labs where research with recombinant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are used. Because the incident occurred at 7:30 a.m., no work was being done at the time, the email says. Building engineers discovered that a \u201cmodule controlling the exhaust damper actuator failed. This equipment failure resulted in the exhaust damper sticking in the closed position and, as a result, the lab went briefly positive to the adjoining lab room. Infected animals are housed in this room, however I want to emphasize that no work was taking place at that time in the BSL3 suite \u2013 no one was physically present in the lab.\u201d The part was replaced and the room\u2019s negative air pressure restored, the biosafety officer told the NIH.

The facility is registered to work with select agents related to diagnosing, treating and preventing disease.\nGeorge Mason University initially sought to charge USA TODAY $167.65 for copies of its Institutional Biosafety Committee minutes and NIH-reportable incident records, which it is required to make public as a condition of its federal research funding. When USA TODAY objected to the fee as excessive for just 114 pages of records and asked for an itemized accounting, the university sent a copy of handwritten notes someone had written on lined paper that claimed even higher costs to release the records: $422.61. The bulk of that cost involved two highly paid employees spending five hours each to review the records before release, the record said. A third employee spent two hours on the records, the university\u2019s breakdown said.\nWhen USA TODAY asked for the dates and times these long reviews occurred, the university said the employees didn\u2019t log their time. However the university told USA TODAY it was reducing its fee to $100.59 because it had learned that some of the charges involved the employees meeting with each other about the newspaper\u2019s request.

The TB lab is used routinely on weekdays, Moyer said. The emergency response lab gets 50-60 specimens per year; most of them are human clinical specimens. \nIn 2003, the state lab commissioned an independent security assessment and took steps to enhance security, including installation of security cameras and restricting staff access in certain areas, Moyer said. In 2008, the lab commissioned an independent safety and risk assessment to evaluate potential hazards the facility might pose to the community. That report, Moyer said, found that the labs were in compliance with regulations and were unlikely to pose a hazard to the community. More recently, the lab has conducted response drills with local law enforcement to ensure prompt response to its intrusion alarms.\nAlthough the state regulates and inspects clinical laboratories that test for human illness diagnosis, it does not regulate research, veterinary or forensic laboratories, Moyer said. Washington also does not have a process for receiving notifications of lab-associated incidents or accidents. While labs are required to report incidents involving select agents to the Federal Select Agent Program, state officials are not notified, Moyer said.\n", "photo": "WA11.jpg", "photo_credit": "Washington State Department of Health", "photo_cutline": "The Washington State Department of Health laboratory has BSL-3 facilities, including a tuberculosis lab and an emergency response lab.\u00a0", "docs": "No", "docs_file": "", "edited_status": "READY", "edited_by": "", "editing_notes": "Blurb, title edited"}, {"lab_id": "WA12", "name": "USGS Western Fisheries Research Center", "city": "Seattle", "state": "Washington", "highest_bsl": "BSL-3", "byline": "Nick Penzenstadler", "description": "The U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s Western Fisheries Research Center operates an aquatic ABSL-3 laboratory in Seattle, said Catherine Puckett, a USGS spokeswoman.

A majority of the spaces are on the main campus, a handful are located in other locations, such as the Influenza Research Institute in a nearby research park. UW performs research on pathogens such as Mycobacterium, Brucella, Blastomyces lastomyces, West Nile virus, chikungunya and influenza. The goals vary but include understanding the pathogens, immune response of the host, interactions with the vector and development of therapeutics. UW is registered to work with select agents. \nThe $12 million Influenza Research Institute was built to support the research program of professor Yoshihiro Kawaoka, who studies influenza and Ebola viruses. Kawaoka\u2019s research focuses on the reconstructed 1918 virus and other highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza, H5N1 and H7N9. Kawaoka is a proponent of \u201cgain-of-function\u201d research, in which pathogens are manipulated to alter their capabilities, such as to become more pathogenic or transmissible. The White House\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy suspended all gain-of-function research in October 2014 in the wake of several high-profile biosafety lapses at federal facilities. In November 2013, a researcher in the ABSL-3 punctured skin with a needle loaded with H5N1. The researcher was given Tamiflu and quarantined for seven days. The researcher\u2019s family was moved to one of the university\u2019s apartment complexes. Lab officials say the researcher was closely monitored, and did not get sick or show symptoms of an influenza infection. In response to the incident, the lab\u2019s workers were retrained and protocols were revised. Rebecca Moritz, a UW lab administrator, said that there has never been a lab-acquired infection in the Kawaoka lab and that in 2014 staff entered the lab 1,500 times and spent 2,600 hours working in the facility.\n", "photo": "WI02.jpg", "photo_credit": "Kyle Bursaw, Press-Gazette Media", "photo_cutline": "The University of Wisconsin Influenza Research Institute building in Madison", "docs": "Yes", "docs_file": "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1698555-wi02.html", "edited_status": "READY", "edited_by": "", "editing_notes": "Blurb, title edited"}, {"lab_id": "WI04", "name": "The Medical College of Wisconsin", "city": "Milwaukee", "state": "Wisconsin", "highest_bsl": "BSL-3", "byline": "Nick Penzenstadler", "description": "The Medical College of Wisconsin near Milwaukee operates one BSL-3 lab and one ABSL-3 lab.
