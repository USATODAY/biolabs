The animal caretaker was put on anti-viral medication for 10 days and told monitor daily for development of a fever. No infection resulted, the records say. The manufacturer of the protective breathing gear replaced all the hoses at the lab and lab officials also required all hoses to have their joints reinforced with tape. \n\nIn June 2014 another employee also experienced reduced airflow through an air purifying respirator while taking samples from ducks involved in an avian influenza experiment. In that case a tear was discovered in the breathing tube. All staff using BSL-3 facilities were retrained on proper assembly and inspection of personal protective equipment.

The employee in this incident was told to monitor for development of a fever twice daily, plus take a 10-day course of anti-viral medication. No infection resulted, the records say.\n\nIn another incident, around May 2014 scientists at the lab observed chickens unexpectedly becoming very sick and dying in an experiment with a bird flu strain that shouldn\u2019t cause such serious illness.

The agency operates other BSL-3 labs in Fort Collins, Co.; Anchorage, Alaska; and San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\nCDC\u2019s labs in Atlanta were involved in several high-profile safety incidents during 2014, prompting a congressional hearing in July and sweeping promises of safety reforms from CDC Director Tom Frieden.  Those reforms have included procedure reviews, more training, installation of camera systems to better monitor safety protocols, and the hiring of a high-level official to oversee lab safety.\n\nIn December 2014, staff in CDC\u2019s elite Viral Special Pathogens Branch working in one of the agency\u2019s BSL-4 suites \u2013 where scientists use spacesuit like, full-body protective gear with respirators to filter the air they breathe \u2013 confused two different types of  specimens of the deadly Ebola virus. Some samples contained live virus that were supposed to stay inside the BSL-4 lab. Others had undergone a kill step to make them safe to send to a BSL-2 lab, where staff generally just wear gowns and gloves. But the wrong specimens were sent to the lower level lab and a worker had to undergo 21 days of monitoring for potential Ebola infection, but was never sickened. \n\nCDC\u2019s investigation of the Ebola incident later concluded that the specimens sent to the lower level lab likely never contained any live virus because the samples were taken from animals in an experiment who appeared to have already cleared the infection from their bodies. While the CDC published a report of its internal investigation, the agency denied USA TODAY\u2019s request under the Freedom of Information Act for copies of the incident reports about the mistake, citing laws that exempt from release certain reports involving inspections or releases of potential bioterror pathogens deemed to be \u201cselect agents.\u201d Ebola is a listed select agent.\n\nIn June 2014 dozens of CDC employees were potentially exposed to anthrax after lab staff failed to ensure the spores had been killed before shipping them from a biosafety level 3 lab to biosafety level 2 lab that wasn\u2019t equipped to work with the live pathogen. The head of CDC\u2019s bioterrorism response lab resigned in the wake of the incident.\n\nIn early 2014, other CDC lab staff mistakenly cross-contaminated a mild strain of avian influenza with a dangerous strain that can kill people, then shipped the contaminated sample to a U.S. Department of Agriculture lab in Athens, Ga. USDA scientists in May discovered the CDC\u2019s mistake after birds in an experiment unexpectedly died. A CDC investigation concluded sloppy lab practices were the cause of the incident.\n\nUSA TODAY has reported for several years about other safety and security lapses at CDC\u2019s Atlanta labs, including repeated problems with air-flow systems designed to keep infectious agents inside high-containment labs and failures to maintain proper security.  Usually private government audits of CDC\u2019s labs, obtained by USA TODAY, found the agency\u2019s labs were cited in 2010 and 2009 for failures to provide biosafety training to many staff working in areas with pathogens that have the potential to be used as bioterror agents.", "photo": "", "photo_credit": "", "photo_cutline": "", "docs": "Yes", "docs_file": "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1691871-ga03.html", "edited_status": "", "edited_by": "", "editing_notes": ""}, {"lab_id": "GA04", "name": "Emory University, Yerkes National Primate Research Center", "city": "Atlanta", "state": "Georgia", "highest_bsl": "BSL3", "byline": "Catherine Sheffo", "description": "The university\u2019s Atlanta campus has eight BSL-3 labs and four ABSL-3 labs, said Patty Olinger, the assistant vice president of the office of research administration.

Most of those exposed will not show any symptoms. But the bacteria can hide for years in the body, CDC officials said. In countries where the bacterium is endemic, the fatality rate for patients with melioidosis can be up to 50%. And even with the best medical care, infections can be difficult to treat and involve long courses of antibiotics, CDC officials said.\n\nThe bacterium has been studied in other countries as a possible bioweapon and Tulane said its research involved work to develop a potential vaccine. Full coverage of the incident is available at: biolabs.usatoday.com. \n\nAs a result of the release of the bacteria, federal regulators ordered Tulane\u2019s primate center to halt all research involving select agents until the cause of the accident was identified and corrections were made. Andrew Lackner, primate center director, said about 10 projects involving a variety of select agents were impacted by the order.\n\nThe CDC last inspected Tulane\u2019s select agent labs in December 2013 and no significant problems were cited at that time. The primate center had never been suspended or subjected to any regulatory enforcement actions before, the agency said.\n\nAccording to Tulane\u2019s biosafety committee minutes, the committee approved a research project involving Burkholderia at its July 25, 2014 meeting. Although the specific type of the bacteria was redacted by the university, researcher heading the project in the minutes lists Burkholderia pseudomallei as one of her research interests on Tulane\u2019s website. \n\nIt is unclear whether this is the same research that was involved in the bacteria release incident.", "photo": "", "photo_credit": "", "photo_cutline": "", "docs": "Yes", "docs_file": "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1691897-la02.html", "edited_status": "", "edited_by": "", "editing_notes": ""}, {"lab_id": "LA03", "name": "LSU Health Sciences Center Shreveport", "city": "Shreveport", "state": "Louisiana", "highest_bsl": "BSL3", "byline": "Catherine Sheffo", "description": "The university\u2019s Shreveport campus is home to an ABSL-3 suite with two laboratories and two animal care rooms, said Matthew Woolard, an assistant microbiology and immunology professor.

The incident on Dec. 29, 2014 involved the potential exposures of two laboratory workers to specimens of a weakened strain of Yersinia pestis, a bacterium that causes plague, that was being dried for a suspicious powders study.\n\nOne exposure occurred when a lab manager, with a bare hand that had cuts on it, ran a finger across a machine\u2019s lid while examining a slimy substance that was thought to be innocuous. The machine \u201cwas only meant to be used with non-hazardous materials,\u201d the report said. A lab tech also was possibly exposed, the report said, while opening and decontaminating the machine.

Researchers there have worked with pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV,) Avery says. The BSL-3 research is directed broadly at developing drugs, diagnostics and vaccines to protect humans from infectious disease. Duke\u2019s RBL is registered to work with Select Agents. Recent research with Yersinia pestis involved testing the ability of some novel compounds to kill the bacterium in the test tube, which could lead to developing antibiotics.

A future tuberculosis vaccine may produce these antibodies as a mechanism of protection from tuberculosis infection.\u00a0In March 2012, a research worker grazed a needle that was being used to inject multiple zebrafish embryos with wild\u2010type M. marinum, a genetically-modified organism, according to documents provided by Dr. Richard Frothingtham, co-chair of the Duke IBC. The worker did not consider the injury significant and did not report the event at that time. About a week later, the worker noted a small nodule on the index finger of her right hand and reported this to her supervisor.

The worker completed a six-week course of therapy without side effects and was last assessed at EOHW on May 7, 2012 and had no tenderness or loss of function.

When new illnesses emerge, such as MERS-CoV and swine flu, public health labs are among the first in the country to receive test methods to diagnose these new diseases, said department spokesman Donn Moyer. The TB lab is used routinely on weekdays, Moyer said. The emergency response lab gets about 50-60 specimens per year, most of them being human clinical specimens. \n\nIn 2003 the state lab commissioned an independent security assessment and took several steps to enhance security at that time including installation of security cameras and restricting staff access in certain areas, Moyer said. In 2008, the lab commissioned an independent safety and risk assessment to evaluate any potential hazards the lab facility might pose to the community. That report, Moyer said, found the labs were in compliance with regulations and were unlikely to pose a hazard to the surrounding community. More recently, the lab has been working to conduct exercises of response plans with local law enforcement to ensure prompt response to facility intrusion alarms.\n\nWhile Washington state regulates and inspects clinical laboratories that do testing for human illness diagnosis, it does not regulate research, veterinary or forensic laboratories, Moyer said. The state also does not have a process for receiving notifications of lab-associated incidents or accidents. While labs are required to report incidents involving select agents to the Federal Select Agent Program, Washington state officials are not notified, Moyer said.", "photo": "", "photo_credit": "", "photo_cutline": "", "docs": "", "docs_file": "", "edited_status": "", "edited_by": "", "editing_notes": ""}, {"lab_id": "WI02", "name": "University of Wisconsin-Madison/ Influenza Research Institute", "city": "Madison", "state": "Wisconsin", "highest_bsl": "BSL3", "byline": "Nick Penzenstadler", "description": "The University of Wisconsin-Madison has 58 laboratory spaces designed for BSL-3 and/or ABSL-3.
